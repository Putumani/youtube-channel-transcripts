at the table with you, Michael Che.
So oftentimes it Uno
Oh, go. You know what?
So here's the thing. Okay, let's

- This.
This is what now with Trevor Noah.
So first, and first
and foremost, welcome, welcome to you
the listener slash viewer,
if you're watching this.
And welcome to our guests, the,
the one and only Ahmir Quest.
Love Thompson.
Someone who is, who's become synonymous
with not just all things music,
but I feel like all things Good times,
which is a, is a great vibe.
You know, when you walk through
the streets, you go like,
man, that person I
associate with good times.
- Good time, guy.
- I, I feel like you made my time a
little bit better because
I was in Washington, DC
that's where we are right now.
And then I found out you are
gonna be in Washington, DC
and I'd been dying to
get you on the podcast.
And then as you always do,
you made things happen.
And I appreciate you for that. Genuinely.
So a welcome to it,
because we're gonna have
such a great conversation today.
I, I, I know it will be. Yeah.
You know, we're gonna be
chatting about your new
book, right?
Hip Hop is history.
We're gonna be talking
about your life, your,
your journey with music.
And man, what happened at the Grammys
behind the scenes buckle up.
Oh boy. I'm excited.
Welcome to the podcast.
- Thank you.
- You know, I, I picked up your book
and you jump into the
book in maybe the most
action packed way ever.
Yeah. Lemme tell you something.
So I'm, I'm obviously biased
because I was there when this
was happening, but in the very
- You hosted Yeah, man.
Oh God, yes. That night.
Do you even know what was happening?
- So I'll set the stage, I'll set the
stage for everybody listening.
Yeah. So it's the Grammys, right?
It is the 2023 Grammys. 2023 Grammys.
- Yeah.
- And this is gonna be one
of the biggest years ever,
because hip hop is turning 50
- And - There's gonna be
a 50th hip hop celebration
that brings together almost every artist,
or every performer,
or every group from hip hop,
from every generation
onto one stage in one mega
blockbuster performance.
You've never seen anything like this.
- Right.
- And the man who is tasked
with putting this together is the one
and only Amir Questlove Thompson.
And, you know, you talk
about how you said yes
before you even thought about it.
They said, Amir, you wanna
do this? You said, yes.
And just like, just like any
amazing action scene in a
movie, we are completely in
because we are thrust into a world
where you realize very
quickly that you, you don't,
you don't just have to
curate a performance
that encapsulates 50 years
of hip hop into like a 10,
15 minute performance,
which is impossible.
- Yeah. I thought it was that whole show.
I was like, getting ready for it.
- But then we realized you
have to manage all of the egos.
Please just, just break it down for me.
- So one of my, one
of my biggest faults is often
that I'm asked to do stuff
like months or years ahead of time.
You know what I mean? So
when someone's asking you
and, you know, three years
before something, yeah.
You'll like, yeah, that'll
be exciting, right?
I'll do it three years from now.
So, you know, Jesse Collins
and Deanna Harmon asked
me to, they have a way
of pitching you that's
like super exciting.
Like, Amir, we think
you should do, you know,
we think you should curate
the hiphop 50 thing.
And I'm on like, the
cartoon character, you know,
like when someone turns
somebody into a Turkey,
like some salivating at the
mouth and all that stuff.
And instantly I got, I got to work.
I figured, okay, I'm gonna
tell the story of hip hop from,
from the breakbeats of
1973 To the, you know,
and I'm going through the, all the eras.
And I was like, all right,
maybe they'll give me a half hour.
So, all right, here's my presentation.
And I said, it's 31 minutes.
And they, the way they laughed
at me, they're like, no,
no, no, no, no.
Yeah, just give us like 10 minutes.
And then once I looked at the list
and realized that it was
10 minutes, I'm like, well,
I'm gonna have to cut this list in half.
Like, I realized instantly
what they really signed me up
for, what they really wanted
to say was, Hey, Amir,
we would like you to be the bad cop
- In
- This situation.
And then I realized, oh, I'm
gonna have to talk to people.
Not only that, just go
through my, my phone scroll.
Like, not even the luxury of them.
You're the Grammys, you, you
can call these people. No.
Like, I gotta get up at 5:00
AM and have a Zoom with Dr.
Dre. It was the most seven
intense weeks of my life of
creatively cutting, whittling things down
to a 10 minute, you know?
- Yeah.
- Standard.
Not to mention the amount of
conversations I had to have
with people that are like,
wait, you only you want me
to fly out there just to do a course?
- Yeah. - Like, I'm only
doing eight bars of a course.
Hell no, I ain't doing that. You know?
So, and then some people were really savvy
'cause they've been in
this situation before,
and they'll say, like,
who all gonna be there?
And then now I gotta
be careful, like, well,
there's da da, hello,
- Hello.
Because the thing is, a lot
of people don't realize,
some people don't wanna
be in the same vicinity,
on the same stage as other.
'cause it's like everyone's in hip hop,
but not everyone in hip hop is
- Together.
Right? So then who all going
to be there was the first thing.
And then now it's like,
well, if I really need you
to do this, then I gotta knock
out these three people Damn.
So that you'll show up. So
there was a bunch of that.
- Oh, man. - Then at one point
there were several groups
who weren't even speaking to each other.
- Yeah.
- Yo, I swear to God,
when I see da, da, da da, yeah.
Yo, he owed me $3,000 from
1998, son and da, da da da.
Look, man, I, I'll give you the
3000 bucks. Just keep, can you, oh,
- Man.
- So there was a bunch of that happening.
- So I'll, I'll jump into this part. Yes.
So night of, so I've seen the rehearsals,
but now the, the thing that
people don't realize is the
rehearsals for the
Grammys are broken down.
Right? So you rehearse when
the people can rehearse.
And so it isn't always
chronological, you know?
So like, you know, if bad
Bunny's opening the show,
he might rehearse like, after
a whole bunch of people.
And, and you're really doing these pieces
and segments and you're doing them.
And you know, you've got Ben Winston who's
executive producing the whole thing.
And, and you know, you've
got the director, Hamish,
everyone's trying to put this together,
but hiphop 50, everyone goes,
we've never done anything like this.
Everyone at the Grammy said, we have never
done anything like this.
- Oh, I know. - And so on the
nights, you know, everyone,
everyone is really nervous.
All I keep hearing in my ear is,
- So you had a earpiece?
- Yeah, I had a earpiece.
- I had a earpiece. So you might have
known what I've gone through.
- Oh, I knew exactly what
you were going through,
but I didn't know what you
personally, were going through the book.
The book lays it out,
and it, it, it's, man,
- So you remember the,
the first act was it,
was it Bad Bunny that started the show?
- Yeah. So Bad Bunny started the show.
- So you remember that whole
elaborate thing you did in the
- Audience?
Like, he's coming through the
audience, they, they drumming,
they banging bad Bunny's walking through.
And then all of a sudden I
hear we, we, we need Amir,
we need, okay guys,
we've got a bit of a pro.
One of the odd we got, we got.
And I'm like, what, what is happening?
They're like, all right, there's too
much noise on this channel.
We have to switch you because
something's gone wrong. Right.
So now I'm like, what's going wrong?
They're like, it's not about
this, it's about hiphop 50.
And as soon as they say
that, I'm like, oh no.
What has happened? What has happened?
- What has happened? Tell, tell. Alright.
So I thought my, my
main fear the morning of
- Yeah.
- Had nothing to do with the production.
I was fine with rehearsals
and everything. Yes.
Like creatively, we were
good. There was a new problem.
And the new problem was
because First Lady, Jill
- Biden, Jill Biden was coming,
- Was in the house.
There's a more intense
level of security detail
- Yeah.
- Than normal. Which,
you know, okay, I've been
to the White House a few times, whatever.
I understand you're gonna have
to go through several stages
of going through metal
detectors and all that.
You know, there's, there's
a few of my in the world
of hip hop that are like, nah, son, never,
like a never again thing.
A never again thing.
Like they see metal detectors
and they're like, Nope, I'm good.
So just to kind
of appease two of these
particular figures, we had to go
through hell and high water
just to make sure that was cool.
Right. Which, once I realized
the last person was finally in
the house, I had two good hours of,
so I got changed, you know?
Yeah. You were walking
the red carpet. Right?
I went to the red carpet, you know, mess
with Taylor a little bit.
You know, we joking
around Yeah. Telling jokes
to Taylor Swift living the good life.
Right. Everything was fine.
And then the second they
introduced Bad Bunny,
suddenly I just started
getting like, code red.
Code Red light get backstage right now.
And what I was told was that one
of our participants is on his way back
to his house in Calabasas, because maybe,
or maybe not a security person
was a little overzealous in
- Yeah.
- Checking our friend's date.
- Yeah.
- He's instantly like, no.
Like, it was just like, this
person's not coming back.
So what they don't realize is that
because we're on a very
specific clock in terms
of camera coordination,
all the visuals, you see
- Every cue at the Grammys,
- The lights, the dancers,
- Every cue Right.
Is so specific.
And that person didn't
drop out from the front
or the back. They dropped out from the
- Middle.
Right. It's not like a thing
where I could just instantly like, Hey,
we're cutting that song.
Now. Nine key people
who are not in contact
with each other have to be told
that we're gonna lose like four minutes
and 27 seconds to like six
minutes and six seconds.
We have to cut that part out.
But the thing is, is a live show
and the show's happening already.
So you gotta wait till commercials
and then run to the light guy
and say, look, during
the hip hop 54 minutes
and 27 seconds, six minutes.
Then you gotta go to the camera person.
Then you gotta go to the graphics person.
Then you gotta go to the,
to the choreographer.
And then you gotta tell the
dancers, Hey guys, I'm sorry,
but da da da just dropped out.
Yeah. So we won't be using you.
Like, these people flew out,
you know, told their family,
- I'm gonna be on tv.
Hey. Yeah. They've been
- Rehearsing.
Right. So it took about 28 minutes
to just tell all those people
that this particular
artist has dropped out.
Wow. And I thought, okay, we're good.
And then part two
happens, which is, oh man,
some genius decided,
and you know, I'm being
sarcastic to present the album
of the year award
- Yes.
- Before the presentation.
- Yeah. Yeah.
- And the thing is, is
like, look, dog, this is,
this is Kendrick Lamar's, like,
you've awarded this guy the
Pulitzer Prize, you know?
Yeah. He's achieved things.
Yeah. He's the favorites.
We already know this, you
know, we already know this.
- But does hip hop know it the same way?
- Because I,
- I feel
- Like he goes a part of hip hop.
- Well, that's what I mean. I feel like,
I feel like nobody in hip hop comes
to an award show thinking
that they're not gonna win the award.
- Kendrick rightfully won that Grammy.
And one of the nominees
was like, I'm going home.
- And that nominee was in the performance.
I remember this happening in my ear.
I got a call from Ben,
he was like, Trev mate.
He's like, we just lost
another hip hop performer.
We're gonna try and figure
it out. But for now, we,
we might need to move things around.
We just gotta, and he is like,
and then it was panic again.
- Yo. So it's, it's four minutes left.
And we just,
and we begged him as he's
walking out, like, yo,
can you please, can
you, no, I'm going home.
And so you got, we have four minutes, one
to make all the edits,
but then I need somebody
to end this thing.
And I'll tell you what I
did. I, I found a closet.
I said, I opened the closet and went in.
They're like, Amir, that's not a room. Oh.
And they're like, what
are you doing in there?
I need silence. And
literally, I just sat there
for two minutes, dead silence.
Like, all right, what am I gonna
- Do?
I thought, I thought you were
having a mental breakdown.
'cause I heard, I heard
during the, the, the cost,
they were like, things are going crazy.
Things are going, things are going wild.
And then someone said,
Amir just went into like a,
a broom closet and he won't come out.
And I was like, well, I
guess he finally cracked.
- No. So this is what I learned
- About the unstoppable
force known as Quest.
Love finally cracked.
- People think that meditation
is like cosmic prayer.
Meditation is just, you
gotta sit in silence
for a long time and brief, and
the answer will come to you.
Now, let two minutes go by
and you can clearly hear
them outside the door.
Like, yeah. Yeah.
And I'm just like, I did
that for two minutes,
two minutes left, Amir.
And I said, I grabbed my phone.
I was like, I can either
text Jay-Z right now,
or little Uzi Vert.
And something told me like, Jay, Jay-Z's,
he's not the king of known.
Let me stop putting that out there.
But he is the king of
No, he's been known to be
- No, no, no.
But he's the king of No, I, I
think, I think in many ways,
I think in many ways, Jay has
understood the thing that you
and I are still working on.
He goes, thank you. But no
- Scarcity marketing.
No. Which I would love to
Oh, I, I would love that.
Matter of fact, during the,
during the whole zoom thing
of me having to pitch people,
- Yeah.
- Dr. Dre also taught me something
because, you know, he gave me a no.
- Yeah.
- And then I was like, all right,
I'm ask him in two weeks and nudge.
I'm like, come on pal.
Can you, can you do this
for me and Dr.
Dre in a way that I haven't
seen since my father before?
You know, like when you,
when you cross that line.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And
your parent wants to give you
that warning before all hell breaks loose.
Dr. Dre said in a very serious way,
which I now use on people.
- Yeah. - He says, quest,
let me tell you something
I really hate to say no twice.
- Damn.
- And the silence that ended, woo.
I was like, woo, one.
Okay, I'll never ask you
to do anything in life.
Two, I gotta use that. Like,
literally. But Jay said, no.
And I, I was just like,
all right, let me just
let me hit Uzi or someone close to him.
So I I, I texted his team
and as I pressed send, your phone dies.
- My phone went out. And so this is crazy.
'cause on the outside, we're
like, we don't know what's gonna happen.
We don't know how it's
gonna happen. It plays out.
And I won't spoil all of
it. 'cause I want people,
I want people to read the,
you gotta read the book,
but I, on the outside,
yo, lemme tell you this.
You nailed it though. You nailed it.
You genuinely like,
and I didn't, JayZ was, I
didn't know I nailed it.
And Jay-Z was part of it.
Basically Jay-Z wrapped along
to every single, every single song.
- Jay-Z wound up being the
star of the show. Yeah.
He did. Him as audience member
- Yeah.
- Was better than him going to doing this
- Song.
No. It, it was one of the
greatest performances ever,
ever, ever, ever, ever.
We're gonna continue this conversation
right after this short break.
You know, there are a few people
who writes a book about
a topic that they are
so inextricably linked to.
You know, when you talk
about the story of hip hop,
in many ways, I feel like hip
hop has had the same journey
that you have had as a human being.
- Yeah. - And the two of
you have been intertwined,
you know, like Twin Souls.
- Yeah.
- Because hip hop today seems obvious.
You know, I, I, I, I went to
a Rangers game in New York,
went to, someone invited me.
They're like, do you wanna
come watch a hockey game?
I, I went, and the thing
that struck me the most was in a stadium
that was 99.99% white
every time out they played hip hop.
And so, I wanna know
from your perspective,
what was the first moment
where you felt like hip hop
was going to maybe be a thing?
'cause you talk about
being this child who was,
I love how you even phrased it.
You say you were eight years old
and you were hearing hip
hop for the first time.
You were washing the
dishes with your sister.
- My sister and I were doing the dishes.
And the intro of Rappers Delight comes on,
and then we hear sheik's Good Times.
So we're just like, oh, it's good times.
And then we started hearing
people talk rapping,
and we just stopped doing the dishes.
Like, wait, what is this?
And you know, it was like a
clock radio in the kitchen.
So we turn it up and we look at it,
and the longer this song went
on, I, I thought like, oh,
I'll never hear this again in my life.
So it was a decision to make, should I run
and get a tape recorder
and record what I'm hearing,
which is exactly what I did.
Like, I ran right to my
room, got a tape recorder,
put the tape recorder to
the box, the radio, the,
the clock radio, recorded it,
and just sat there and listened.
You know, Rapper's Delight
was 15 minutes. Right.
So I came in at like, maybe
the three minute Part,
and I wrote that entire song down.
I was supposed to be
in bed at like 8, 8 30,
you know, I was eight years old.
I probably stayed up, I was allowed
to stay up till maybe nine 30.
And I transcribed all the lyrics.
And then I went to school the next day,
me performing Rapper's Delight
for like all my fourth
grade class members.
Yeah. And that's, you know, of course,
like adults were like, oh, never last.
It's a fad. But when
it really called to me
was in 1988.
So there was like a, a,
a fifties themed McDonald's called Big
Owls based on happy days.
And I worked there,
and this is the morning
that it takes a Nation of
Millions by Public Enemy came out,
which if you know of their
production style, it was a very,
they wanted to sound like
music's worst nightmare.
So they would just pack in
like 19 samples in one song.
- Right.
- Just sounded like they, they said
that they wanted their music to sound like
what crack feels like when
you, 'cause it was the crack
- Hair. Oh, damn. I didn't know that.
- Which is why all my chapters
are based on the five year.
- Yes, yes. You
- Know?
- Yeah. - The, the first
phase cocaine second phase,
- Or Yeah.
You, you have, you have one
of the more interesting ways
of breaking hip hop down.
Like where, where most people
would talk about hip hop just
in a decade or most, you
know, they would say,
this was an era you broke hip hop down
by the drug that was
pervasive at the time.
- Yeah. - And you know,
it's one of those things in,
in standup, we always talk about it.
We go, there's always that moment
where a comedian will get on stage
and they will say something
so painfully obvious
that you don't understand
why you never saw it.
But it is so genius
because nobody could see it
because it was right in front of them.
I feel like you revealed that with,
with the way you broke hip hop down.
- Like, well, well, when
Chuck D said like, we wanted
to be music's worst of nightmare,
because it was the crack era.
He wanted his music to
sound what crack felt like.
- Right.
- And then I realized, oh,
so when the chronic came
five years later, Dr.
Dre slowed the music down. Yes.
And that's the sound of weed.
- Yep. - But then when the
97 Bad Boy era really started
to kick in, that was the
sexy, that's, that's the, the,
the ecstasy era.
And then when the south first
started coming in, that's the,
the scissor era.
And then of course, with,
with with Molly, opioids,
fentanyl, like we're, we're going
through each phase every five
years, our, the drug of choice
that we self-soothe on changes.
That's how the music changes,
- Right.
- Like, this is the numbing era.
This is the, this is
the era of no feelings.
I, I don't want to feel numb. Damn.
And some people are totally
emo so you either 12000% emo
or no feelings, which is
why everyone sounds numb.
Like that's why mumble
culture doesn't make sense
to my generation.
Like I grew up in the crack era.
- Right. Because it doesn't,
it doesn't match up with
what you experienced
or how you were living,
how you were living that life.
I, I genuinely love how you,
how you find these threads.
How you, how you connect them,
how you, you know, in, in,
in the book you talk about
your journey in hip hop,
the roots journey in hip hop.
And, and I love the connection
that you have with Tariq,
where it's like, you know,
here we are seeing the
foundations of Black Thought
and Quest love seeing them
go from boys growing up,
as you say, you know,
from tweens to teens,
from teens to young men.
And then, and then you,
then you're in hip hop.
- See, our narrative was
that we were working class musicians,
which really isn't sexy.
There's, there's nothing sexy about, Hey,
we're a hardworking band.
Because the, you know,
the narrative, a lot
of the narrative, especially
of the crack era, which is
1987 to 1992, is the idea of winning.
- Yeah.
- Which is why the idea of Scarface,
we don't love the movie Scarface.
The idea of Scarface is what we love.
- Right. - If, if anything,
I think like Jay's life sort
of mirrors that.
Like I'm a buck the system.
- Right. - And then I'm gonna
evolve and become the system.
Right. Right. That's pretty much
how like America was
built like off of everyone
- Money. Yeah. The Kennedys
- Drug, the - Rockefellers,
yeah. You name it, you name
- Corrupt money.
And then somehow they became the right,
- You become the establishment. The
- Establishment, the respectable
- Establishment
- For us though, had Tariq
and I like, again, even the
idea, we were really the roots
of name only because like
we went to high school.
When you're in high school
and boys to men are boys
to men in high school,
and I don't mean like this
before they had a record deal,
but it was like The Beatles on Sullivan.
Yeah. Like they would walk down the block
and girls ah, oh my God.
And singing the girls in the back.
And I'm like, oh, they're cheap, man.
Like singing the girls.
And like, we can't do that.
And so we started a group,
but it was a name only.
And it was only when I was
coming back from my audition,
I auditioned to go to the
new school or Julliard
and coming back home, Tariq
was with me for my audition.
This Real Pretty Girl
and kind of a, a gray poupon
commercial way says, excuse me.
Are you the, are you the
drummer that plays in
that Spike Lee Bucket commercial now?
Yes. I was the drummer in the
Boys been Motown Philly video,
but because a very popular Spike
Lee commercial for the Gap.
- Yeah. - Where it was like
a bucket drummer. Yeah.
You know, we see musicians
busking all the time,
but back in like 1991, it was weird
to see a guy playing
drumsticks in, in a bucket.
And she was so beautiful.
And I said, no, I'm not.
And she's like, oh, okay.
And she sauntered off and left the train
and Tariq looked at me like, you damn.
And so cut to the next day,
we're watching Soul Train
and that Spike Lee commercial comes on.
- Yeah. - And literally it
was like the, the Eureka,
what I call the, the, the doc Brown
flex capacitor inspiration moment.
Like, we just slow looked at each other.
Like, yo, let's do that.
And cut to two hours later, us going
to South Street busking.
And you know, the summer
of 1992 is kind of
where a year later
we'll have a record deal
and we will be the roots
as you know it at least.
Right. And the thing is, is
that in our narrative, like we,
we just never had a story of like, we won.
And that's what hip hop was at the time.
- Yeah. Like,
- I won, I got more than you. Right.
I've, you know, we were telling the truth.
We weren't rich, we weren't, you know,
- We Yep.
Put your rollies in the
sky waving side to side.
- We didn't think to lie to people.
- Yeah.
- Or I don't think it's lying to people.
I think it's sort of manifesting
what your future is.
Yep. And then it comes,
- But Okay.
But then what do you, what do you think,
what do you think the secret
to your staying power has
been as a group?
- When people used to ask
before, I, I would playfully joke
that, you know, the, the
reason why the Roots existed
for 30 plus years is
because two tour buses,
and I used to say
Slithering and Gryffindor,
but I, I now realize something, which is
oftentimes artists have this
obsession with perfection.
- Yeah. - You hear Michael
Jackson like, it must be perfect
Prince's world famous for rehears,
this band like 15 hours a day.
Perfection. Perfection.
That's not the key.
The key is like, when you're
trying to manage your destiny
or rehearse your destiny, it never works.
Literally, all you have to
do is left foot, right foot,
left foot, right foot.
And yeah, some of those
times are trepidation.
There've been moments where like,
I don't like the way the
audience looks like, ah,
they don't know who we are. Like
- Yeah, yeah.
- You know, and I feeling overthink
it, but it's just show up.
So I don't think, you know, people,
well you guys are super
talented, you know, you da da da.
You, you have the ability
to collaborate with whoever.
Nah, we're, we're still,
we just, we show up.
And that's literally, I
believe that's the true answer.
I try to make science of it, of it all.
Like, well, you know,
'cause we're responsible
or, you know, we're drug
free or we're, you know,
- No, just,
- We just to count, show up.
Ah, we just, you literally show up.
- But I, you, you know
what I think it is, I,
I think I would love to hear
what what you think it is
as well is like, I think as artists,
if we're honest about it, there
is a great fear that comes
with doing what we are doing
because you are directly
attached to the product
that you are creating.
- It
- Is a direct expression of who you are.
Is that it, it's a direct moment
where you are exposing yourself.
It's like another
opportunity to be rejected.
It's another opportunity
for it to not go. Right.
It's another opportunity. You know,
like let's say the music
itself can go on without you,
but when we talk about,
let's say a live performance,
every live performance
is a new performance.
Do you know what I mean?
Yes. You step on stage
and if your timing is off, and
if your drumming is off, and,
and you know, and, and, and if, if,
if Thor misses some lyrics
or if he messes something up,
that crowd doesn't say, oh no,
it's fine because the album is perfect.
They go, that was terrible. But
- You know, you show me someone, I mean,
no one actively plans on
Let me ruin this moment.
- Yeah. - But I guarantee
you, at least 90% of the time,
it's someone that's in their head.
I, I learned that worrying
is literally praying to be sabotaged.
Woo. Man.
I I, I hope I don't drop a
drumstick When you worry,
when you allow your brain
to go to that place.
- Yeah. To focus on the thing.
- Shout out to Lauren Xander for
and inventing the term man of fucking,
that's when you start man
of fucking, so it's, it's,
I guarantee you, behind every moment of,
of that level of sabotage
or bad performance.
That's because a person's
mind's not clear.
I don't like, before you go on stage,
'cause your, your level of
entertainment is more intimate
because you have to talk to people.
- Yeah.
- Like, do you, at least I have
to sit in silence 15
minutes before I go on stage
or DJ just so that I can ground myself
and No, get in that zone.
- I'm the complete opposite.
- Oh,
you gotta be all hyped.
Listen to music and
- I'm No, no, no, no, no.
I, I just, so it's funny,
everyone has a different routine.
So Chris Rock, he has like,
he almost has like a meditative zen quiet,
everyone has to leave the room.
- Right.
- And then he
focuses and he goes in. But he's also,
- Does he still have that prince?
- I think
- So. Does he have his prince? I think
- Yeah.
But I think, I think he's also one
of the most precise comedians.
So I get why he needs that, you know,
and then Kevin Hart, he's like,
he's like a lot more loose.
He'll just do the thing.
He'll laugh with people.
You know, Dave Chappelle's
always playing music.
That's one thing, like
when you walk backstage,
Dave Chappelle is playing music,
and the music is setting the scene,
setting the setting the vibe.
For me, it's, it's people.
I, I need my people backstage
because really? Yeah.
Because the thing I'm trying
to do is, for me, I'm trying
to bring you, Trevor, when I get on stage,
I don't wanna become somebody else.
I'm not trying to become somebody else.
I'm trying to introduce
you to the funniest version
of who I am.
And that is like, when people
know me, when people meet me
for the first time, a lot
of people are disappointed.
They're like, oh man,
I thought you'd be a, I
thought you'd be a little more, I
I thought you'd speak more.
I thought you'd be funny. I
thought, but I'm like, no, I,
most of the time I'm
processing information.
I'm observing the world. I'm quiet.
- I was about to say, you're
the first comedian I met that
like, if, if, if any
particular artist has a kind
of a duplicitous existence
where there is Dr.
Jekyll and, and Hyde. Yeah.
Comedians to me are that like
every comedian I know it's like
life of the party on stage.
- Yeah.
- But the level of of darkness
- Yeah. That I
- Witness
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Out of it. And then I
realized like, oh, comedy is one
of the, one of the best
distracting nothing to see here.
Like, I don't want you
to see the real me. Yep.
So let me be funny as hell
to, to throw off the smoke.
- Yep. - But you, you actually,
you might be the, the,
the beginning of a new generation
that might be genuinely you
and adjusted, at least
from outside looking in.
- Yeah. No, I honestly, I try
to be, I try to be as much
as I can because, 'cause I realized this,
and maybe you, you can
relate as a performer,
what I realized was if I'm
gonna spend my life doing
something, then I would like
to spend my life doing something
that'll help me be the best
version of me versus spending
my life doing something
where I'm somebody else.
And then I have to come to
grips with the other person I am
whenever I come off stage.
Do you know what I'm saying?
- Yeah, I know.
- So that's why what I'm trying
to do is I walk out onto the stage
and I'm trying my best for
you as the audience to feel
what I'm like with my friends.
And if you meet me in the streets,
and if I'm at a restaurant
that's me, that's like,
that's just how I am.
Because then I don't have to turn it on
and I don't have to turn it off.
And I don't have to
think about who's, well,
which Trevor's coming today,
which Trevor's showing up.
No, I, I I like that.
- I used to worry about that
because I think for, at least for me,
it was really, I'm in a,
I'm in an even weirder space
because I know I have
people that admire me.
- Yeah.
- But it's not, again,
it's not the Beatles hard days night.
Like, no GA pack
of girls aren't chasing
me down in the alleyway.
And it's weird, like sometimes
I'll walk down the block
and it's always like, you
know, some guy's like,
dog like, da da da.
That album changed my life, man. Yeah.
Back in college and thank you very much.
And it's always, and I'll, I'll
be high, like, wow, thanks.
And then what always happens
is whoever he's with,
usually his date or whatever,
I can hear maybe like five seconds
of the conversation as I walk away.
And it's always the tune of
like, you don't know Quest, love
the Roots, you know the
Roots, you know Jimmy Fallon,
you know, yo you remember
Will Smith's name, you know,
you know Quest love.
And that always just,
but I always, I, I used
to always, I always say
that I was the person that w
would sort of self-evidence
reasons why I don't deserve stuff.
- That's interesting. So that's it.
You, you talk a little bit about that.
I would, I was sort of Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Figured a little bit
about that in the book.
- And I, that's gonna ground me.
- But actually, actually, I
actually would like to get into that.
Like, you know, in the
book you talk about almost,
almost experiencing hiphop
through an anti hiphop lens and,
and not against hiphop,
but rather the, the, the,
the machismo in hiphop,
the, the, the vibe.
You know, for instance, even
when we talk about weight,
there's, there's a really
fascinating part of the book
where you're talking about how,
you know, biggie and Big Pun
and, and, and Fat Joe, and,
and all of these artists,
how they use their weight
in a different way.
Rick Ross, you name it.
And, and you very
candidly share your story
and how like you are grappling
with your weight in a different way.
And you, you don't seem to
have the same command over it.
And it's, it's not a,
it's almost not a, a
tool in your option. I
- Never thought this could be sexy.
Yeah. For me, I realized
late, super late in my life that
we are going
to self-soothe on something
when we're not aligned.
- Yeah.
- Like, I now don't, I don't see like a,
a cocaine addict as like,
oh, you just chose drugs.
I now think like, okay,
you're self-soothing
because of another issue.
- Right.
- And there's different types
of addictions that we don't think about.
Like, we don't think that Yes.
There's, there's the greatest hits one,
there's drugs and alcohol.
- Yeah.
- There's gambling,
but then there's some other
that we don't think about.
And for a lot of it, the
amount of times that I've
like celebrator, like let's go to dinner.
- Yeah, yeah. - Or you know,
in the studio I'll just have,
you know, my writer like 10
different types of cereals.
Like, I didn't realize the amount of times
that I would just casually, I'm a foodie.
I, I write books about food. Yeah.
So, you know, I called it,
my excuse was being a foodie,
but then someone challenged
me once during the pandemic,
like, well, I dare you
to, to, to not do that
and we'll see if you're an addict.
And literally like, I was
like Chris Rock in New Jackson City,
like, I need Captain Crush.
I need captain. And I didn't realize that
that was my drug, you know?
How did you, I didn't realize
that this was my shield
to keep people away from me.
Oh, wow. I You don't, you
don't realize that at the time.
So, and it's, it's, it's
an everyday struggle.
Like just to, just to, you know, I want
to be an example without being
the, the the guy that you,
like, you see on Instagram.
And I don't wanna be the, I don't want
to be the hall monitor.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. You, you're not the
instructor type, you're the Yeah.
- I want to lead by example.
So, I mean, the fact that
Chuck flavor iced tea
ll in a few seconds are making
it to 60 is like that's a,
a true reason for celebration.
But I also know
that those individuals have
also reached a crossroads in
their lives where they have
to, you know, I didn't know
that Chuck Dee you like, revealed
to me that, you know, he,
he does meditations and
- Yeah.
- And, and do these things
that I used to laugh at.
I used to laugh at all. Yoga, meditating.
- But then how do you, how
did you find the balance?
How did you, you know,
one of the things I I,
I notice about us as people is we, we risk
swinging wildly from
one extreme to another.
So I'll meet people who, like
you say, they self-soothe.
They, whether it's food
or whether it's partying,
or whether whatever it is.
And then I meet them, and
then now it's like they
self-soothe by being
the complete opposite.
And it's ex it's extreme
and nothing is a joke, brother,
let me pray with you for a moment.
Let me meditate with you in this moment.
And I, I don't, everything
is a devil. And Yeah.
- You know, when people get a new toy
- Yeah.
- Like, I, I, I had
cousins come home for jail.
Like, and you know, the,
when you do a bid in jail,
like you're, you're going
to either find God or,
or you know, have my
family's Muslim, you know,
like prayer rug in the
middle of the street.
Like, all right, all right, here we go.
Alright, give you a salon. All right.
Now can we talk about the, you know,
TV again, I was that person.
And then I realized like, you,
you gotta be the example instead
of preaching the example.
- I, I wanted to ask you that about music.
Do you, do you, are you able to listen
to music without the, like, the rule?
And, and I don't mean the rules of like
what music is supposed to be or not be,
but there are a few
people I know of who can
break music down.
So for instance, you have these
playlists that you'll send out to people.
- Right? Right.
- And one
of the reasons I love your playlists is
because I love discovering new music.
So when you listen to music,
I I, I'd love to know like,
are you able to turn off your
precision and your perfection?
Or are there, are there
moments where like, it,
it bites at you?
- I'm, I'm a stickler for detail.
- Okay.
- And so the reputation of,
of the roots being a band or
whatever, is often the fact
that we can mirror mirror
exactly what the song does.
Chorus kind of in a, not in a karaoke way,
but you know, the artist always says, wow,
you guys sound just like the record.
- Exactly.
- Right. And so
- I'm, - I'm always, I'm
always on the band about like,
no, the, the thing goes like
this on the record, you know,
does the average layman person care?
Probably not. Am I tightly wound?
Probably so, but someone
has to be the captain.
So that's usually where
I'll get the, the ridicule.
Like I know on the other
roots thread without a mirror,
that's where I know that,
where the conversation's going.
But the reason why, well, the,
the main reason why I did these playlist,
I think I started doing this way back.
Blue Ivy was born when like
2013, oh geez. 2013 I think.
- Yeah. I'm terrible with yours.
- Yeah. 20 13, 20 12, around that era.
And so my gift to the
Carters was like, look,
and this is back when it was just iPods.
I said, what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna fill up a whole bunch
of music with iPods
and in our crib, you know,
just have this music playing.
- Oh, that's beautiful.
- And then, you know, 'cause
I think if you can get kids
before there's, and I don't
mean like, I'm not the guy
and the guy that wants you to
listen to the music I listen
to, so that,
- But it's just being exposed
to, it's like languages.
- I think it expands your mind.
So I initially started
making iPods for the Carters,
but then Jay will be like, nah,
we kept them things through ourselves.
Like, like, and then
the other thing was kind
of my occasional eye roll at o Obama's
summer playlist.
Like, okay, all right, who's
really feeding you this music?
All right, let me let man,
nobody gives him credit.
Come on, let me, let
me, and I'll hit him up.
I'm like, yo dog. Like, okay,
who's your trainers doing this?
Like your interns?
So what wound up happening was,
initially First Lady Michelle had me
make her a bunch of playlists.
'cause she was doing
like a, a book tour Yeah.
And wanted cool music
to play when she would do
her speeches, whatever.
And then, then it just started expanding.
So it's, to me, I'm the guy
that's willing to, you know,
do the needle on Haystack
for the perfect song.
All those songs that I choose
are songs that like, that
give me goosebumps.
Like no song is on there by accident. Make
- A moment.
Okay. Not, not to put you on the spot,
but if, if you were to choose five,
just five songs where you go
- See
- No, no, no.
Just like, and it, it might be like,
it might even be the top of
mind that I'm looking for.
I know. I'm you on the spot.
- I'm gonna songs I'm
gonna tell you something
- From Five Genres where you
go, you are on an island,
you're trapped, this is it.
Five songs for the rest of the time.
You can't even make music five songs
- When off the clock.
I don't listen to music
more than I listen to like
ambient noises.
- Oh, that is fascinating.
- So right now, like if
you were to say like,
what is my favorite song
for me, fork tuning,
fork tuning music is my all time.
It's not even music anymore.
The sounds of like, that
to me is like, 'cause I need that.
My life is so chaotic.
But I mean, if, if you
just want me to name like,
tangible songs
or tangible music, I would choose.
Okay. If, if you're a fan of
Brian Wilson, of The Beach Boys
and you know the story of how
he struggled for 40 years to,
to make the follow up
to the Pet Sounds album.
He finally completed this
album, I think in 2009,
2010 or whatever.
Like finally it's, it's in complete stage.
It's called Smile. And there's
a song called Wind Chimes
that is just my, my relaxing place.
- So that's the relaxing one. I like this.
- That's the relaxing one. Number two,
bill Withers has a version
of Grandma's hands on
live from Carnegie Hall.
- Okay.
- 1972. 73.
That has a long monologue
at the beginning of it.
And when I was a kid, my parents
and grandparents used to always make me
perform the monologue.
Oh wow. Bill, bill Bill's
telling the story of, of
what it was like growing
up in West Virginia
and his grandmom's house
and going to church.
And it was like the comedian thing,
like white churches and black churches.
- Yeah, yeah,
- Yeah. Black churches do this.
- Yeah.
- White churches do this.
And I used to do that routine
when I was like three or four.
So let's say the live
version of Grandma's Hands
- Okay.
Live version. What does that
do feeling wise for you?
- It's probably the, the
rost childhood memory I have
- With like, okay.
Okay. So it's like, it's warm.
- Yeah.
- It's like a,
- It's that warm
- Feeling.
All right. Okay.
- There's a song called,
there Comes a Time
by the Tony Williams group.
Tony Williams was the
drummer for Miles Davis.
He went solo and did a song
called, there Comes a Time,
there Comes a Time was
the, the First Night
of the Roots, as you know it,
when we saw the commercial
and went on South Street to Busk.
- Yeah. - It was such a
victory night that at the end
of the night we took our
$120 and we went to Wawa
and to get a hoagie and some lemonade.
And we just sat in the car
like feeling accomplished,
thinking like, so we
gonna do this next week,
or Yeah, we gonna do this next week.
We might make $200.
And this avant garde DJ
had played Tony Williams.
There comes the time. We
just thought it was the
oddest thing we ever heard.
And it turns out we don't
know it at the time,
but that DJ will wind up being
like the roots of Brain Trust
and Longtime Manager until we passed away.
Leukemia Richard Nichols.
So we will meet that person
in about three months,
not knowing that he was the, the DJ
for Jazz 90 or Temple.
Damn. That's beautiful.
So that's the, that's the
- Weird one.
So we got calm. That's weird one. Yeah.
We got calm, we got homely, we got weird.
What's like a hype? Is
there like a hype song for
- My generation?
When Rebel Without a Pause
came out by Public Enemy,
the song actually
encapsulates the, the angst
that teenage me feels inside
that can't express it.
- Right, right.
- This, this loud siren
noise that keeps going.
Like it's every parent's nightmare.
But for me it's like, yeah,
this is how I feel inside.
You know? So Rebel Without
a Pause by Public Enemy.
- Enemy. I like that. Okay. That's like
catharsis. I like that.
- Yeah.
- All right. And then
- Final song, the last song
I'll say is a rather normal
song, but there's a moment where
in 1983,
prince releases a remix version
of Little Red Corvette.
Now are you familiar with the, the phrase
it's called code switching?
- Yeah.
- So code switching.
For those that don't know, oftentimes if
you come from one side of
town, you might often have
to chameleon yourself to
adjust to where you're going.
Switching to that office
voice. Right? Yeah.
So if I'm backing my old neighborhood at
home, good to see you again buddy.
Right, exactly. At home
I know to lower my voice.
Yo, what's up man? How you doing?
Yo, I'll take out shrimp
fried rice. And, huh?
Well, oh, we, that's what's
up. Yo, thanks. Thanks.
But when I'm at office,
hello there. How are you?
Like it's a level of
code switching Prince,
what makes Prince such a genius is often
when he releases singles, he knew
what he would have to do in order
to gain the audience that he wanted.
Oh, interesting.
Which is why songs like
Raspberry Beret exists,
which is why I like nice songs
like Take Me With You Exist.
There's, there's a level of
of wink winked that he's doing
to a white audience that
he's trying to grab.
But he's also telling his black
audience, I know where I came from.
You know what I mean? So he'll
re he'll often remix the song
and ize it in very subtle
ways that, that you don't notice it. I
- Like that. Okay.
- So what happens is,
12-year-old me is thinking
that he's hearing the album
version of Little Rick Corvette,
but then suddenly in the,
in the three minute period,
the baseline changes.
And I'm like, wait, this,
this feels different.
This is not the am fm radio rock song
that little Red Corvette
was suddenly it's,
it's black as shit.
So what I'll later learn
is that oftentimes for,
for a pop radio, you'll
wanna stick to major chords.
- Okay. - Because it feels
safe and it feels inviting.
Minor chords. The black
keys are often dark.
And that that's sort of up our alley.
You know, it's funkier, it has edge
to it, there's mystery to it.
There's, there's bite to it.
And the moment I realize
that you can turn any song
into the major version,
which is safer, or the minor
version, which is edgier,
that totally transformed me.
So for me, hearing Little
Rick Corvette, the, the, the,
the remix dance version just
that made Prince God in my mind,
- That unlocked something in you,
- In a way that no other
artist could, could do
that Don't
- Go anywhere.
'cause we got more What now after this,
You know, I'll tell you this, Amir, like
there are a few things that I have been to
or experienced where there is more law
that is spread about them than
your legendary game nights.
Yo people's, the amount
of, of law and fiction
and myth about your game
nights is out of this world.
People ask me questions.
It's almost like your game
night has become Illuminati.
Because people will say to
me, they'll be like, Trevor,
I saw, I saw you made it into one
of Questlove's game nights.
Right? Pray to tell what happens in there.
I heard, I heard that
there are, there are people
and you're like, it is a
game night. It's just a game night.
- Someone once joked to me,
they were like, you know,
I can't believe you hit jackpot doing one
of the most wholesome, it is
the most wholesome events.
It's so wholesome ever. I'm embarrassed.
The reason why I don't talk about it,
the reason why I'm sort of
like fight club with it isn't
because we're doing this
Debas Studio 54 thing.
It's, it's Studio 54 levels of fun.
- Yes.
- But it's so
- Yes.
- Damn square.
And I think I happen to know that
that's the specific reason
why people come over.
'cause the thing is like, okay,
we'll invite about maybe
we'll, we'll try to aim
for 60 people and we'll
carefully curate right things.
And I gotta go through, you know,
some people have security details.
Yeah. Some people have,
you've seen the amount
of people that have been here.
But the thing is, is that it's,
it's such an unpretentious
normal moment.
I'll give you an example.
Alright. So the first time
that Taylor Swift came
- Yeah.
- It was literally to zero
fanfare. Like she just walked in.
Yeah. And I didn't even know,
I didn't even know she was
there until 10 minutes in.
And I was like, oh, okay. She
did show up. That's what's up.
She sits down at Bum be's table.
- Right.
- And plays Uno.
And that's the thing,
like what I realized,
the reason why I threw game night is
because I don't, I work so much.
I don't prioritize joy man and fun things.
And oh man, I'll mon I'll,
I'll figure out a way
to monetize my joy.
Like DJing used to be my joy.
It's still my joy. But now,
- But now it's also your job,
- But it's a job.
It's an occupation. Yeah. Drumming is a
job and an occupation.
Journaling, what is a
job and an occupation.
But these used to be my, my passions.
So with game night, at
least there is a four
to five hour period in which
60 strangers are amongst each
other, just playing around.
But then the next night I'll get the text
and it'll just be like, yo, man, like,
dude, thank you so much.
Like, yeah, no, it's, I
gotta talk to JJ Abrams about
what I thought, da da da da da.
And this designer's
talking to that writer.
And it's not even an elitist
thing 'cause I have no,
- No, no.
Half of the room is just
friends of Questlove
who nobody knows from anything
or anywhere that, that's just, you know.
- Right. - That was, that
was the most fun I had was
sitting at the table with, with your boy.
I don't, I don't even
know where he's from.
- But it also, but it also
tells me a lot about people.
The way Michael say hit
me like, yo dog, man.
I was like, yo, you, you have fun.
'cause this whole thing
was like, he couldn't,
Michael j was one of 'em cats
that couldn't quite realize
like, wait, so we're going,
we're just coming to play games.
- Yeah.
- And I'm like, yeah,
we even had like one particular
artist who's like security
detail had to come and sweep the place.
And they asked us like, so
you, where's your medic at?
And I was like, medic. I
was like, yeah, you know,
medic in case something happens.
I was like, I said, dog, that
ain't that type of party.
Like, they were like, wait,
you guys are really here to,
and the way they laughed,
- We eat cereal.
- You're here and we play
- Uno
- To play games.
- Yeah. - And I was like,
yeah. And they looked at each
other like, wait, that's all y'all doing?
I was like, yeah, we're playing games.
And they couldn't believe it.
And then they witnessed it and
was like, oh, this was fun.
But literally at the end
of the night I hit him
and I was like, so what'd you think?
And he was just like, man,
he's like, Trevor kept,
now I know Chay is the type of guy
that will pull another rule out
of his hat without establishing
- Completely.
Completely. Right. So let's get into this.
I like how will be
like, your reputation is
that you're a rule follower.
Here's, here's, but so am I.
No, but here's the thing
that's more specific for me.
- Okay. - I'm competitive.
Okay. We start with this.
I'm competitive and the thing
I never understand is this,
if we cannot agree on
the rules of a game, then
how can we agree on who
has won or lost said game.
- Right?
- The thing that gets me is I'll be play,
let's just agree on the rules.
I'll be playing Uno with somebody.
I'll be playing crazy eight with somebody.
I'll be playing whatever card game it is.
I'll be playing a game with somebody
and then they'll go, oh no,
that, that doesn't do that.
So it's like, okay, wait, let
me just look. Official rules,
- Right?
- This is what I'm saying,
official rules of Uno is
that if somebody puts down a take two,
you cannot add to that.
Now I'm saying I play the
game where you can as well,
but let's, yo man, I can play
and one I can play NBAI can
play like, you know what I mean?
Three, three V three.
I can, I can play every style of game. See
- A lot of my black guests.
All right? So I gotten a lot
of pushback from my black guests
- Because we add, we stack
- Into, right?
So I, I, there's, there's
levels of stacking
and I don't, I love stacking,
but let's agree that
we're stacking I I get it.
Yes, you're right. And
- So let's agree people.
That's all I'm saying. Because sometimes
what happens is it goes
halfway around the table
and then someone else goes, oh no,
but we don't, you don't stack.
And the, and then everyone at
the table is like, oh, okay.
No, not okay.
- Yeah.
- So, okay, so here's
what happened on that one in particular.
So we weren't playing one game.
So what I love about your
game nights is you, you'll get
to a table, you'll find a game.
Yeah. You don't even know
what game you're gonna play.
So you get to the table, there's a whole
bunch of games laid out.
And on this occasion
there was a Bobby version
of Uno. Okay.
- Yes.
- Which I've never played
before. I don't think
anyone's played before.
- Tell us every type of
- Game.
Yeah. There was like a
special type of Bobby Uno.
So, so now there were new rules.
- Yes.
- Okay.
So now everyone's at the
table going, what do we do?
I now, I'm not the kind of person
who will pontificate on the possibilities
of playing when I can just pull
out the instructions, the rule books.
Right. If we don't know
how to play the game,
let's read the instruction.
So I go, let me read the rules.
Michael Che goes, of course
you're gonna read the rules.
Then I'm like, what do
you mean? Of course I'm,
do you not wish to know
how to play the game?
He's like, I'm sure we can figure it out.
I'm like, we cannot figure it out.
I don't know what a Margo Robbie car does.
I don't know if you do. He's
like, we can figure it out.
No, Michael ch We cannot figure it out.
And my thing is, Michael Chase's so cool.
He's gonna be like, he's gonna ooze cool,
but he's one of those people
who confidently walk down the wrong road.
Right. Just like I'm the
kind of person to be like,
let's pull out a map and see
if we're headed in the right
- Direction.
You, you and I are the same.
Yes. Right. We're born in the same,
- So I read the rules
and it turns out like
the America Ferrera card
and the Margo Robbie
card are very different.
Exactly. And there's a lot of things.
You got the Issa ra card
has a different vibe. Yeah.
You, you know what I mean?
The Kate McKinnon card does
a completely different thing.
So these are all things
that I was trying to explain
to the group so we
could make the game fun.
'cause if the rules don't exist,
then the game isn't Michael.
- But yeah, you a reputation as
- Yo man
- As the hall monitor
- Man, he, he, even at the
table, he was roasting me,
he roast, you know what I,
I had every trauma from school come back.
I knew it where I felt like a nerd
who had like actually done
the reading or actually done
- Teachers sp teachers that That was him.
Exactly. That was him. Michael
was like, I went to therapy.
It was good for someone
to have it instead of me
because I'm always the teacher.
You're usually that guy. So
I was like, whew. All right.
Trevor took the, the heat off me.
- This is like, I'm here for game night.
I'm not here for socializing
night, I'm here for game night.
The socializing is secondary
to that experience.
So I'm here predominantly for the game.
- I've realized. So Mo, moving
forward, we decided that
each table should have their own captain
and that captain will
establish what the house
- Rules are now.
That is what I'm talking about.
- So next time, Trevor,
you'll have your own
table. It's your rules.
- I don't even need to be a captain.
I just need the captain to know
what the rules of the game are.
- No, you're a captain dog. Like,
- Eh, I'll take it.
I love it, man. Thank you so much.
Thank you for being here now.
'cause honestly, this is wow.
Thank you.

- You are the most
awkward person I know in
certain situations. Sure,
- Sure.
I felt it. I feel every time this,
this is a thing about being awkward
that people don't give enough credit for.
I know what's happening.
I also wanna leave, but I
don't know what to do next.
'cause it's my fault.
You see? But now, now I
- Feel bad for
- You.
I, but here's the thing, I don't feel bad.
I just know it's happening.
I wish I could stop it. Okay.
I'll, I'll give you an example.
If someone tied you to
a chair, you know that
to get outta the chair, you'd
have to break the ropes.
- Yes. - But you don't know
how to break the ropes. Right.
And you don't have the strength
Right. To break the ropes.
That is me in every conversation.
- Except you're the person
who tied yourself to
- The chair. Yes, yes, yes.
- You are the person tying
yourself to the chair.
And then you sit there
looking at the other person
like, oh man, this is weird.
- Yeah. I look at the other person, like,
I shouldn't have done this.
- Hey, what's going on everybody?
Welcome to another episode
of what now the podcast
where we talk about all the conversations
that are invading your brain.
Yeah. That's how I see them.
They're invading your brain.
This week we're chatting about rocks.
The rocks flying in space,
the rocks under your feet,
and the rock, who is no
longer involved in politics
Now, the only thing I enjoy
more than having conversations
is having them with some
of my favorite people.
And this week I'm joined as usual
by my good friend Christiana.
All the way from Los Angeles. Yes.
She's a mom, she's a thinker,
and she's a person with
a voice once again.
And what a treat.
I'm joined by the one and
only Josh Johnson, comedian
and human being in the same space.
Touch my blood. That's
what we say in Africa. Touch my blood.
- Yeah. You like that? That's
that's way harder than shake my hand.
- Yeah. Touch my blood.
- I love that.
- That's what that is. Yeah.
We started doing that when AIDS
was spreading. Like really?
It was like a big thing. Oh,
okay. Yeah. Oh, too late.
You touched it. Yeah.
Welcome to the podcast.
This is what now with Trevor Noah.
Happy podcast day,
everybody. Happy podcast
- Day,
- Man. Happy
- Podcast day.
- I've missed you, Christiana.
It's, it feels like it has been
forever since I've seen you.
- I missed you, Josh,
and I missed you Trevor.
I, I'm glad I have a voice again.
- Yeah. It
- Feels good to be able to speak.
- Someone asked me if it was a,
if it was a gimmick or a gag.
I, I don't know what people
think. Someone asked me this.
They, they were, I was in
an, I was in an airport
and someone came up to
me and they were like,
I love the podcast so much.
And they're like, I have a
girl crusher on Christiana.
Please tell her. And they're like,
but I, I just didn't understand.
It was the vo is the voice
thing real? What was that about?
Then I was like, what do
you mean? Is it real? What?
Please explain. Sometimes I don't,
I don't think people understand comedy.
- Yeah.
- Because please ex explain to me
what you think the premise
of this joke would be.
That we would say Christiana
doesn't have a voice
and then there's no payoff.
- Yeah. Yeah. Then she's just back one day
- And then she's just back.
- Yeah.
- Christiana, how's the family?
How's everything going?
- You know, I'm having a
bit of a They're good that,
you know, the headline
is, the family's good.
I should always lead with that.
- You're so African when
you do that. That No.
Can I tell you that's the
most African thing that, that,
that you'll do, which reminds
me of everybody from home.
You'll ask them a question
about life or anything.
They start telling you the truth
and then they catch themselves.
And then they'll be like, you know,
so they'll be like, how's everything?
Like, ah, man, you know
things, you know what?
You know what? I'm blessed.
Let me start by saying
I'm blessed. This is
- Yes. Yes.
- This is literally what you, what you,
it's the most African thing. I know. It's
- Also
- Like I know, I
- Know.
- It's such a deep southern thing too,
because just like when you're in the
south, like I was just in Raleigh.
Yeah. And when you talk to anybody,
they'll start telling you
about their day earnestly.
And then they, they feel like
they're wire tapped by God,
because then they'll start
telling you about their day
and they'll be like,
but God is good though.
But let's not forget
that God is good. Okay.
So I know I got hit by a car
today, but Ooh, God is good.
It just got hit by two cars.
- It does feel like that.
Yeah. It really does feel like that. Yes.
- God is good. He is
good. He's always good.
- He's all the time. All the time.
And now that, now that
we're on a secure line,
tell me your, your, your real story.
- My real story is this.
Okay, so, so I have a
almost 10 month old named Luna.
Wonderful little girl,
but she's like, she's doing
things differently to ob.
Did like, Obie had teeth at
three months. Luna has no teeth.
She refuses to crawl.
She sat up a bit later
and you know me, I'm like, I want her
to be a doctor or a lawyer.
So she should be walking in my books.
So we keep bringing it up
with the pediatrician
and the pediatrician.
She's fine, she's fine. But
take her somewhere just to check
and I'm Of course we're gonna take her.
And today we found out she
is fine. She's just lazy.
So she needs physical therapy
to get over the laziness.
The ability is there,
but the desire is not
Wait, which is a worry.
'cause she's supposed to be a doctor.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait. Sounds
to me like she's not lazy.
Sounds like she's a genius.
- Yeah. It sounds to me
like she's not gonna be a
doctor or a lawyer.
She's gonna be the president.
- That's, I mean,
- Either the president
or she's gonna own, like
create a tech company
that has no value, but sell
it for like $2 billion.
Which is I am fine with that.
Like that that's a good outcome.
- Yeah. If I was a parent and
I, they told me that my child
- Yeah.
- Has figured out
- Yeah.
- That they don't need to crawl.
I mean, they walked so that I don't have
to crawl is essentially
the world she's in.
She's a trail, she's a trailblazer.
- Trevor, I feel like you've just made up.
I feel like you've made it up,
but I'm gonna, I'm gonna rock with it.
- Do not deny the genius of your child.
- Yeah.
- And you'll see in like eight months,
Luna's gonna be on the podcast.
She's gonna be like Beyonce's children.
- Yeah. Yeah.
- She'll just be like,
featuring on the podcast
winning us Grammys.
Today's, today's episode of
the podcast is gonna be fun.
There's a bunch of things happening.
I will tell you a little
bit about where I was
because again,
some people think I didn't
tell them where I was going.
Some people ask me if
I was gonna get a BL,
that's why I disappeared and
wouldn't say where I was going.
Which was a strange one.
The fact that people
think I needed a bbl L
- Yeah.
Talk to talk to 'em.
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah. Yeah.
- The worst thing about
these kinds of rumors is
that now people see it
when they didn't see it.
So if they go like, you went to go to bbl,
they're like, I can see.
Then you're like, that,
that's how I've always been.
Then they're like, no, I would know.
So, so do either of you know where
Bhutan is?
I mean, if I was betting money,
I would say Christiana knows.
Again, Josh, this is not an insult to you.
I say this because I
wasn't completely familiar
with where Bhutan was.
Christiana is somebody
who's extremely learned
and she went to university.
I don't know that you went to university.
I didn't go to university. So
before you get offended at all.
- Yeah. - I'm just put, do you
know anything about Bhutan?
- Sometimes you say
before you get offended at
all, but you've already said all the
- Things.
- Yeah. He is like, no offense, I
- Apologize,
- But I'm about
- To thank you.
Okay. I, no, I apologize. I apologize.
Josh, what do you know about Bhutan?
- I know that it starts with a b
- Christiana, - What do you,
what do you know about Bhutan?
- I dunno that much about Bhutan. I don't,
- Do you know where it is?
A lot of people don't
even know where it is.
- Is it near in, near the
Indian Ocean or am I wrong?
- No, so it's actually
in the Eastern Himalayas.
Eastern Bay. I'm just
telling you the thing.
Oh man. Oh, you just took
me back to my childhood.
I have, I have a, I have a
cousin who tries to do that.
They try and answer the questions with you
to act like they always knew that, man.
Thank you for that, Josh.
Thank you so much for that.
No, so, so I, I, I, I was in Bhutan,
that's why I went for a week.
A country that is, is really interesting
because they, they only got
the internet and TV in 1999.
Place was pretty much closed
off from the whole world.
And then now they don't have a GDP,
they measure their success in
what they call the GNH
Gross National Happiness.
And so you, you go to a country
where they're like, oh yeah,
money doesn't determine how
well the country's doing.
We measure it on people's
general health, their connection
with their family, their
time, their free time.
And so I went there and I
just spent a week essentially
with monks, them just telling me about
happiness the whole time.
- And was it like, when
you were talking to them,
was it an an inspiring experience
or were you like, oh,
like, like, or were they,
- Were they fun monks?
Can, can I, oh, okay.
First of all, I'll say
this, every real monk I've
met is fun.
- Okay.
- Fake monks. Yeah.
Fake monks are the ones who are like,
there is nothing funny in the world.
And you know, if you're like,
I had a bad day, they're like,
there is no bad and there is no day.
Ah, those guys, those guys,
those, those monks are assholes.
The monks like, like the real, real monks.
They're great. They have a good time.
- Wow, - Okay. Yeah. The,
the one monk was like, Hey,
you should follow me on Instagram.
I was like, you have Instagram?
He's like, yeah, everyone has Instagram.
I was like, oh, but you're a monk.
He's like, I don't, I don't get
what this has to do with anything.
You gonna follow me or not?
And then I thought he was joking.
Yeah. And then the next
day I saw him again
and he's like, you didn't follow me. Yeah.
- Did you have to be like, silent?
Like what, what, what were
you doing for the week?
Apart from being like the
CIA asset that you are, I,
- I spent a lot of time meditating.
I, I'm gonna ignore that comment
because I've found inner peace
and you, okay, lemme put it this way.
It was, it was, it was
interesting to go to a place where
they're trying to
redefine the very idea of
what success is, but
from the country level.
Do you know what I mean? So
- Yeah.
- These people, for instance,
I, I played a game of poker
where they didn't play with money.
They played with pushups.
- That's hilarious.
- It was actually, can I tell you,
it was actually the most stressful game
of poker I've ever played.
- That's so good. That's
- Like, literally, you bet.
And you go, I raise you two pushups.
And someone's like, I raise
your two pushups there,
six pushups, eight pushups.
And then at the end of each
round, people are doing pushups.
There's no money exchanged.
Same game, same enjoyment.
But people are doing pushups.
And you, first of all,
you'll be shocked at
how quickly you start
curtailing your gambling
when you have to do pushups.
Yeah. I was like, this could
cure Vegas in like a week.
- Yeah. Yeah.
- If you said everyone in Vegas had
to do squats or pushups
every time they lost
- This is, this is the best.
Because now your gambling
addiction looks sexy.
- Well now you'll know who
has a gambling addiction.
- Right? Yeah. Like, you'll see
somebody with just the chest
and no arms and you'll
be like, Ooh, he's sick.
He sick, poor. We need to pray for him.
'cause he got no legs.
But he got that thick
- Chest.
That's, oh man.
You know what I, I feel enlightened and
- I feel some of that
light. Yeah. I love that.
- Like, I, I, no, I feel like,
I feel like you're a
hater. That's what you are.
- I'm not a hater.
- I'm
really, I'm feel like you're a hater.
- I'm a hater. I'm always
- You're a hater,
- Professional hater.
- You're, I'm
- Always a hater.
- Yeah, but you're different.
Josh right now is just
that you are being you.
Josh has stepped out of himself to step in
and and hate on me.
- I'm not hating at all. I'm
glad that you told me about this.
And I will think about it sometimes when I
freak out about money.
- You know what we're gonna
do? We're gonna take a little
break When we come back, I will tell you
what would've happened to you
a few hundred years ago if you had this
exact same attitude with me.
We're gonna continue
this conversation right
after this short break.
When was the last time
either of you watched
or saw an eclipse
- Today?
- You saw the, you went outside and you
- Did
- You have, did you have the glasses?
- Look, I'll tell you this right now.
Everybody was trash a truck
for looking at the sun.
But I almost did it. I really
did because I had the glasses
and bef when the thing was
starting, I couldn't see anything
because the glasses were so good.
- Yeah.
- And then I started to see a little bit
and I was like, I do kiwan.
Just take 'em off real
quick. Just get a sneak peek.
- But did you take them off? I did
- Not
- See, I didn't not fit to be president.
Christiana, you, when was the
last time you saw an eclipse?
- I've never seen an eclipse.
- Huh?
- Yeah, I avoid them.
It feels too spiritual.
Too much of a shift. I stay
- Indoor.
Yeah. It's, it's, it's, I I will say this,
it is both the most powerful
and meaningless thing
I've ever experienced.
Because it was like a, it was,
it was one of those moments
where, you know, seeing everybody outside
for the same, I, I don't know.
There, there was a, there
was a, the last time I saw
New York, like that was
during the pandemic.
And so in a, in an emotional way.
It was, it was really wonderful
to see everybody outside
for something that wasn't morose.
Something that wasn't sad, something
that it was just people gathered together
to look at the sky,
turn dark for a moment.
- Yeah.
- And, and enjoy like everyone,
I mean like construction
workers, high school kids.
Literally, I just, I was riding a bicycle
through New York watching
it the whole day.
And it was just, everyone
was just standing on the side
of the road with, I don't know
where they all got them all.
By the way, that's, that
I will say is like weird.
I don't know. Everyone in
New York had eclipse glasses
and I don't know where they got them from.
I don't know where I got
mine. It's very suspicious.
I think a lot of people
are gonna have some
long-term vision problems.
'cause nobody knows where
they got their glasses.
But, but I started
reading up on everything
that the eclipse has meant for humankind.
It's amazing. Like,
like you say, like wars.
There, there was a war that
there was spoken about,
like back in the day, I think
it was the ancient Greeks.
And they, they basically, they had a truce
because they, they were just
like, yeah, man, even the moon
and sun don't want us to fight.
And then they just stopped
fighting. That's beautiful.
- Yeah. Yeah.
- That's, that is so beautiful.
And then to you, earlier
when you were trashing me
with my poker pushups, if
this happened back then,
- Yeah.
- I could have killed
you during an eclipse
and no one would've said anything, Josh.
Why wouldn't they have said anything?
Because it would've
happened during an eclipse.
And eclipse was what? Like,
so that's the thing I learned.
The eclipse was the perfect
time to end other people
because during that period, you
could say you were ending it
for the eclipse or because of the eclipse.
So if you, if you killed somebody
during an eclipse back in the day,
and then people are like, what did you do?
And you are like, yo,
the demon biab took over
when the sun was gone.
- Okay.
- And then you say to people,
I would never, you know me.
Come on man. You know me.
Have I ever killed anyone?
- Yeah. If you kill me over
a comment about the poker
pushups, you were waiting to kill me.
Like the, the, the eclipse had nothing to
- Do with it.
No, don't.
- Josh,
- Josh, please. If you
- Haul off and choke me now.
Oh, you've been waiting.
- No, no. Maybe no, no.
I don't know. I just, I just liked it.
I I, I was sad that not everyone got
to experience it everywhere in the world
because it was just like a
moment over the east coast.
- Yeah.
- Of, well, Texas, you know, sort
of like the east of, of, you know,
- They also didn't all look the same.
Did you see that? Like the one, the,
the eclipse in Mexico was
a little redder than ours.
- That's racist. Josh,
- I,
- That's
- Racist. Yeah.
- I, and I cannot believe Josh
- Cancel me.
I cannot believe Josh said it,
- Not me.
That you would take this moment,
you would use the eclipse Josh
to, to further your ideas.
Josh, Josh, Josh of, of
superiority and supremacy.
Josh just said, y'all ever notice
how the Mexican eclipse looks
a little red? Wow. Josh.
- I said, red or not. Wow.
I didn't say Josh Johnson.
I didn't say darker. I said,
- Wow.
Very problematic. Josh Johnson.
- I'm just throwing it out there
that everyone doesn't have
the same eclipse experience.
- Why? Because the eclipse
in Mexico doesn't have a job.
Is that what you're saying, Josh?
- I did not say that at all.
- What are you saying Josh?
- I was just saying that
I think it's beautiful
that all over the world, just
'cause you're here, this New
York eclipse is not the same
eclipse as another eclipse
and another eclipse.
- Some of us, Josh, we
don't see colors in eclipse.
- Yeah. 'cause it's blacked out.
- I I didn't even see that it was black.
One of the, the worst stories
and also one of the best
stories I will preface
because just it's, it's interesting
was Christopher Columbus, right?
He got to the Caribbean.
Him and his men landed on the shore.
The people at the time
like say Jamaicans for now.
Like, you know what I
mean? Jamaicans were like,
yo, what are you doing here?
And he was like, well, we're
coming here to do our thing.
And they were like, no.
And they had a huge fight
and there was a bit of a
war and they were winning.
And then Christopher Columbus remembered
that the eclipse was about to
show up in like a few days.
And then he said to the
Jamaicans, he was like,
my God will punish all of you for
what you have done if you don't repent.
And the Jamaicans were like,
what are you talking about?
And then the eclipse happened
and the Jamaicans were like,
damn, God is on his side.
- Yeah.
- And the rest is history.
- I mean, I would do
something similar just
because if you go back to
medieval times, the only people
who could read were also
people in the church.
So then a lot of science
also came from the church.
So there were people
dabbling in both at the same
- Time. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- And I would be like,
Ooh, God mad. Look at that.
He heard you owe me the 10.
Because I, because when
I taught God, listen.
And I told him how you owe me the 10
and you, you acted all big and bad.
You all wanna pay me back
'cause you bigger than me.
- You using an eclipse for $10. Josh
- Shillings.
- Okay.
- Probably
- My bad.
My bad. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't know this.
During an eclipse, animals
don't know what's happening.
Right? For the most parts,
nocturnal creatures have woken up
because they think it's nighttime.
Birds shut up.
During this happened for
real in New York, by the way.
I was in a park. Birds were
chirping, chirping, chirping,
and then silence.
- Doesn't that creep you guys out?
- It doesn't. It is creepy.
- I get so spooked out by No,
that's why I stayed in my room.
I don't, I don't wanna be around it.
I just wanna pretend it's not happening.
- What do you, what
are you spooked out by?
- I, you know, I was raised
by, you know, Africans
who believed that Christ rose
from the dead in three days.
So I just like, which
did my sense a reality,
which you did not like
everyone else did. I'm
- Going to heaven.
- I don't, nobody
- All, but,
- But like, I'm like, oh my God, I just,
that kind of stuff creeps me out.
My husband's gonna be so
embarrassed when he listens to this.
'cause he was like, you
need to believe Moreor in
science, which I do.
I vaccinate my kids. However,
eclipses creep me out.
Like, you being like, the
birds stop chirping. They do.
- Yeah, they do. And
- Animals come out of certain areas.
I'm like, nature is far more
powerful than I want it to be.
I hate nature. That's the issue.
- You know, when you talk
about it being scary or,
or any of these things in South
Africa right now, there's a,
there's an ant I wanna say epidemic.
If you leave anything anywhere, you,
you've never seen this many
ants in your life, ever.
And I, when I went home recently, my,
I experienced this firsthand.
It's like, like, like
Gilligan's Island type ants.
Like they will lift you up
and they will move you around.
I'm, I'm not even sure,
you've never, ever,
ever seen this many ants in your life.
Geez. So everyone in South
Africa has been going, why?
There's so many ants. What's happening?
Where are the ants coming
from? It seems like the
devil, something's going crazy.
You know what I mean? And
then like around the world,
there's been all these stories of like,
either animals acting strange
or tides being different.
Or then you had the earthquake right?
In Taiwan and people were
like, oh yeah, there's,
there's earthquakes cut to New York
had like a four point something
- Earthquake - And people didn't
even know which way to go.
Do you run up? Do you
run down? Do you run?
- Yeah.
- Like in la
because like, if you're in
California, they tell you what
to do and there's an earthquake
because they earthquake
ready in New York.
People just, yeah, we
- Built buildings high.
- All cocky. Yeah.
But some, some people are saying
that the world might be ending.
And I don't know.
- I mean, I really hope not.
'cause things just start
to go, well, for me,
I need at least four, four
or five more years of earth.
And let me see why I take this thing.
- You one of those, you
one of those people.
If the, if the world was ending
and you knew for a fact
it was ending in a week,
would you do anything
different in your life?
- Mm, I would probably go to
England. That would be it.
But only for a couple days.
And then I'd come back.
England is kind of like
Oliver twisty right
now. So I wouldn't wanna be there for too
- Long.
Wait, too long. Wait,
wait. You're gonna go there
for a few days?
The world is ending in a week.
- Yeah. I'd go there for a few days
and then keep living my life
the way I've been living it.
- Wow.
- Because I feel like I'm living the life
I'm supposed to do.
You know what I mean? I'm raising my kids.
- Yeah. - I'm doing work. I
what, why would I do? Wait,
- Wait, wait.
You would still go to
work? You would still go
to work if they told you the
world is ending in a week?
- I like writing. I actually like my job,
Trevor. No, no, no, no,
- No. That's that's
- Not, that's not what
I'm, I'm, I'm with you.
I, I think if, if,
if I thought the world was
ending in a week, right?
I would go, my girlfriend and
I would go see my mom. Right?
I'd go hang out with my mom.
I'd do a show in Atlanta.
Then I would take Sally and my mom to Boan
and I would play poker
for pushups until I un un
until my arms fell off.
Really? Like I, I might have a, i
- I I, I don't know if I envy you
or if I feel sorry for both of you.
The world is ending in a week.
There is no one you would cuss out.
There is no thing you would do. But I cuss
- People out anyway.
Trevor, wouldn't you live like
me? And you just say how you
- Feel? All right. I'm
- Cussing people out.
- Okay. That's different.
- I'm yolo
about cussing people out.
- I'd also buy a sword.
Now this is what I'm talking about. Oh
- Yeah? What kind
- Of sword?
- What type of sword?
- We are talking a full on saber.
- What? Wait, what were you,
what are you doing with them?
- I'm just walking around with
'em, letting people know what's up.
- Trevor,
- What would you do?
- Yeah,
- If there was a week left.
- Whew.
- Okay. There's a few things I would do.
I would take crack, I would
take heroin. You would
- Take crack.
- That's
- Wow. Take crack is what do you, what do
- You mean?
- Sounds like somebody has never done
- Crack.
The fact that Yeah. I've
never done dope take. No.
That's the most CIA thing done.
You've ever said I would take crack?
I would take, I take crack.
This is, I feel like you
Wait, what do you do?
What do you do? You smoke crack.
I can't believe you sound
like the most wired up person.
Writer. I would take crack. Wait, you you
- Smoke
- Crack?
- Yes. You smoke the crack.
The difference is taking crack.
Yes. 'cause you don't imagine
if I was like, I I'm about
to my partake in some alcohol. It sounds
- Josh, that's what you say every
weekend when we go out.
Whatcha are you talking
- About?
No, no. I've never said that.
Whatcha are you talking about take
- Crack?
You said I will unleash,
- Take myself upon other people if I
took you somewhere right now.
If I took you where I grew
up. Yeah. Right. Yeah.
So we go to like the Sonia quarters. Okay.
Of, of, of Alexandria, Louisiana. Right.
And if you say to the dealer,
I'd like to take crack,
we will be shot.
We we we will be shot so
- Fast.
- Alright, fine. I will
smoke crack. Thank you.
And I will smoke heroin. Okay.
No, you can't smoke heroin.
But you gotta,
- Trevor you inject heroin.
- Yeah.
- Trevor, I told you he's CIAI
- Knew if I, if I was CIAI
would know all these things.
- No, I would know all of these things.
You're too busy going
to Butan. And, and and,
- Okay.
Okay. Look, either way.
So I would do heroin, I would do crack.
I would take a shit on the sidewalk.
This is something I've
always wanted to do.
I I just think there's some occasions
where you like going somewhere
- And
- Then you, I hate the whole
like, do you have a bathroom?
Can I use your bar? And then
they give you that giant key
with the heavy thing on it.
And now you're at their mercy.
And then you have to buy something.
Do you want the code for the
do I just think sometimes it
would be nice just like a
dog to just like find a spot,
do your thing, look at people while doing
it and just keep on moving.
The world is ending in a week.
Remember all of this is
happening. I would do that. Yeah.
- Best true. Six five. Like a six five.
Dude, I'm, I'm gonna act like
I want a high five. Right.
Because they love that. 'cause
they think I can't re they
they think I, it's like touching the wind.
So then they're gonna,
they're gonna do this. Right?
And then right when they do this,
I'm gonna punch 'em in the
balls as hard as I can.
Yeah. Yeah. And now he's
my height. Doubled over.
- Yeah. Oh man. You know who is six five?
You could try that with is the rock. Oh,
- You know, this's the thing. Save
- That thought.
Yeah. Okay. 'cause we're gonna
talk about him after this.
Okay. Don't go anywhere
'cause we got more What now after this?
So if, if you haven't followed the story
and you've somehow managed to avoid it.
So Dwayne the Rock Johnson made a special
appearance at WrestleMania.
He's, he came back to compete. What, what?
He's, he's 51 now. So it's pretty special.
- Came - Back to compete.
Wrestlemania's really taxing the
last time he was there,
he got badly injured.
Anyway, he goes back, he does, it's,
it's triumphant it's an amazing return.
But this thing gets
overshadowed by the fact
that the rock goes on Fox News
and says that he will not
be endorsing Joe Biden.
Right. Everyone goes crazy.
People obviously Fox fans
are like, yeah, that's it.
Joe Biden is, is is a screw
up. And, you know, screw him.
- Yeah.
- And then people, you know,
who approach Joe Biden are like,
why would you do that to us?
The rock? You know, you know what
- I mean? Yeah. Yeah.
- It's okay. Here's what's,
here's what's weird to me, a few things.
First of all, he says he's
not endorsing Joe Biden.
And he says he's no
longer endorsing anyone.
So he's also not endorsing Donald Trump.
- Yeah. Yeah.
- So I don't understand why
that's not a headline,
- But it, for some people it's
an addition by subtraction.
So they're so, they're like,
you endorsed Joe Biden last time
- And, and now you're not endorsing
- Me and now you're not.
So you're at least coming closer to me is
how people see it. Okay,
- I see that. I see that.
- And - Yeah, I, it kind of
worries, it worries me a lot
that people take their
voting guidance from
a wrestler turned, actor turned, turned,
the businessman turned everything.
- Yo Like guys,
- Once, once Donald Trump. I don't
- Believe once Donald Trump became
president, all bets were off.
- Sure. Like, I'm sure. But I think I'm,
- Yes, I'm biased because
the Rock was on this podcast.
I'm biased 'cause I've spoken to him of,
but I think he would be more considerate
as a president than many
presidents America's had.
- I think that that would be incidental.
I think that if, if you, how about this?
I, I don't know how to fly a plane.
So no matter the intent
I have when I, when I try
to take off, I'm still gonna kill
everybody when we try to land.
So just because he's
more considerate doesn't
mean he's more polished.
Doesn't mean that he is more understanding
of policy. You know,
- This dude, guys, I hate
the celebration of politics.
I despise it so
- Much. I agree with you.
- I hate that people take so
much guidance from like, it,
it drives me up the wall
that people even care
what he thinks about politics.
Like I really would like wrestling
guidance from him working
out, guidance from him,
business advice from him.
But I don't necessarily
need his opinion on
how I should vote in a
school board election.
And the fact that so many people
do care what the rock thinks. Very
- Worrying. Well,
- We're in a bad way guys.
- First of all, he is the people's champ.
Let's start with that. He's
the champ of the people.
But secondly, no, but, okay,
here's why I'll give him credit.
He's never told anybody how to vote.
In fact, he's done quite the opposite.
Even in this interview.
He's essentially saying,
he's essentially saying he
doesn't wanna participate in
politics anymore
because he saw that all
it did last time was
basically just get him hate.
- But I would say this is, this
is my thing with with that,
with I, I have no problem
with anything he said except for that.
Because the thing about
division that I think a lot
of people don't understand,
and I'm not trying
to take him specifically to task,
but I want to use, take him
- To task Jess.
- Okay. I do. Yeah. Go,
go for it. He's not here.
- What's he gonna do?
- Yeah. Come here. He won't
- Beat you up.
- Yeah.
- I hope you got your save ready.
- You look, you look at
the rock. The rock is
from Hawaii. Right,
- Right. Okay.
- Okay. So he is from Hawaii
and there are, there are
both people in terms of,
of politicians and people in
terms of corporations that want
to take as much land as they
can from, from the people
of Hawaii and use it for
other things. And don't care
- What happens to the people.
- I imagine he would stand
against something like
- That. Yeah. Right. Okay. Okay.
- So when he stands against
something like that,
he's not causing division.
'cause that's what someone would say.
They'd be like, oh, we're
just trying to bring jobs
to Hawaii and you're over here causing
division. Do you, do you see what I'm
- Saying? Yeah, I hear what
- You're saying.
And so I think him endorsing
Biden, I think that, like,
that didn't to me cause division.
He just said who he was voting for
and to your point, didn't tell
anybody else who to vote for.
But now he's worried about
causing division by just saying
what it, what he's doing.
And I, and I do think that a little bit of
that is worrying about the check first.
I don't think, I don't think it's
- Necessarily No, but I think,
I think what he's saying is
he's causing division in his life.
I don't think he was saying
he caused division out there.
He's just causing
division amongst his fans
and his people. And, and you
- Know, I don't think division
is intrinsically a bad thing.
Right. It's just how we deal with division
and how we deal with conflict.
So I I I didn't, that kind
of rubbed me that part
where he is like, oh, it caused division
and caused, I just think
those conflicts can be useful.
My, my real issue comes back
to I do not believe in the theater
of public ideas that we have.
- I agree
- That the rock's opinion
should hold that much weight.
It really worries me
because there are, like for
instance, if you are a mother
that you send your kids to
your local public school.
If you're in an area that's deprived
and you're dealing with
bad roads and bad schools,
and you know how it bad housing,
we don't care what those people think.
And those people have opinions about
who their elected officials should be.
Right. And I'm, I think we listen
to the wrong people in this country.
And it's not just unique
to the US around the world.
There's become this celebration of
who I wanna take my
political opinion from an
influencer on Instagram.
- Yes. - I don't care what
that Instagram thinks about
some sort of conflict.
What the hell do you know?
Why do you have to puppet?
You know? I mean, I think
we just demand this,
I feel actually bad for the
rock that we demand this of him
to endorse somebody.
- I agree with that
actually, because I, I don't
- Think he knows any better than anyone.
I, and I I, and that's
what kind of annoys me.
It doesn't, I don't actually
care who he votes for.
I, I care that we demand somebody
like that to actually say
what they feel politically,
because I don't think there
are any more sophisticated than
your average person.
And maybe we should listen to experts.
Well, that maybe be a good thing.
- I I also, I also think,
and maybe, maybe that this was taken
or this was inspired a
little bit by the eclipse.
I do feel like maybe just
maybe we should consider
the possibility that it is
better for some things in society
to remain impartial slash
you know, non-party affiliated slash
i I think it might be nice for the world
to just go the rock is just the rock.
Yeah. Whether you're
Republican or a Democrat.
- Yeah.
- The rock is just the rock.
Maybe it's nice to just,
you know, share these things
as people and, and not have,
because to your point,
Christiana, if we don't want
or think that these people
should have an outsize influence
in how people vote
or don't vote, then
maybe there's some merits
to them just being the thing
that brings people together.
Like, imagine this during
the eclipse, at the peak
of the eclipse, all of
a sudden the eclipse was
like, vote Trump.
Yeah. First of all, I'm voting Trump.
I'm just gonna let you
all know that's happening.
Yo, the eclipse said it. Yeah,
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- And now I as Trevor, there's
a part of me that'll be like,
what does the sun know
about American politics?
- Yeah.
- Do do. So
- I'm on the other side.
I'm actually on the,
I like, I believe the,
I don't think we need to
depoliticize any celebrity.
I don't think you need
to depoliticize yourself.
I think people need to accept
that we're more than our,
it gets complicated that you
can really like the rock. Ooh.
- It's hard
- As, as an actor, it's hard. It's hard.
But you can write him as an actor. You
- Can, it's hard
- Him as a father and his work,
but you may not like his politics
because it's just like, that's
what it's, there are people
who I know, like politically
I really agree with them,
but I think they're kind of bad people.
I don't like them. Yeah. I don't, I
don't wanna be part with them.
I agree. Even though
they're politics on paper,
we agree completely.
But I'm like, I actually
don't think you're
a decent human being.
And I think we need to
be able to allow for
that in a society where we're like, okay,
the rock votes for so and so.
Does it change how I feel
about his work a bit.
But I have to accept that who he is.
And I think if we could
live in that nuance,
it'd probably be a better world.
- Oh, here's what, okay.
Here, here's, I, I I agree
with the sentiment of what you're saying.
The reason I don't think we can do that is
because po politics
fundamentally at some point make
some people feel whether it's real
or not, that their lives
are being threatened.
Right. So I think it's
hard to say to people, Hey,
ignore how the rock or
somebody else is voting
or has voted when you believe
that their politics inherently
threatens who you are.
Like actually are. Yes. Yes. So, so
- No, I'm not saying to,
I'm not, I'm not saying to
ignore it.
I'm not saying to ignore it.
- Yeah. But I'm saying, I'm saying you,
I'm saying you might have a,
you might have a, an ability
that most human beings do not.
The ability to ignore
or to be able to put aside
how somebody has voted.
I I I don't know how many people
- No, I include it in the per I don't,
I don't put it aside. I
think that's a, I just,
- You make it one of the
- Things,
it's like the sum of it part.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's
- Part of the thing. Right.
- I'm saying that's, I'm saying
that's special. Yeah. Yeah.
- It's just, no, I don't, I just think if,
I think if we're will, if
we're gonna be really human
and accept the messiness
of what a human being is
- Yeah.
- You're gonna know it's not
always gonna be coherent.
And I think we live in a time
where people don't wanna live
with that incoherence or that paradox,
and they wanna pretend that
people are just one thing.
- So here's the thing. I agree.
That's why I say I, I agree
with the sentiment completely.
But growing up in South
Africa was interesting
and weird for me in that
like, I got to see democracy
for the first time in a country,
not many people have lived
through that experience.
Right? So in South Africa in 1994,
we had our first elections ever
where everybody could vote.
And I remember I was a child
and it was the biggest thing
ever lines that, I mean like,
it looked like the whole
of South Africa was going
to a Taylor Swift concert,
let's put it that way.
Right. The biggest message
was, your vote is your secrets.
Your vote is your secret.
And I remember, I didn't understand it.
I was like, why should
your vote be a secret?
I mean like, and it, it was
almost agreed on all the black
people were voting for the A NC
because this was the party that had
liberated them, et cetera, et cetera.
But still, people were like,
your vote is your secret.
Your vote is your secret.
And I remember asking,
it was a teacher
or somebody, I was like, why
is your vote your secret?
And they were like, because
if people know how you vote,
you may not be able to
continue voting that way
because they might want to
kill you or threaten you.
And obviously in South
Africa, we had a lot
of political violence.
Right. But the thing that stuck
with me was just this idea
of how I don't, I don't
know, it's a weird, in,
in many ways, I think of it like this,
politics is a lot like sex.
Everyone has their own proclivities.
There may be things that
you believe in politically
that I don't agree with
or that are strange to me.
But I think if we know all of
these things about each other,
it's a lot harder for
us to exist in a society
where we take each other as,
as as whole human beings.
It, it'll be very hard
to look at Josh the same way when you know
that he uses a saber during
sex. Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah. When you know, I have that thing,
- It's like, it, it just
changes how you are with people.
And I don't know, I feel like, yeah.
I feel like one of the things
that's hurt America is the fact
that now people start conversations
with their political affiliation.
Whereas before, I remember,
even in my lifetime, it used
to be a thing where people didn't,
if you said, how did you vote?
They'd be like, well, come on.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
That's not how I,
- Yeah.
It used to be more like sex.
- Yeah, yeah. People would
just like, like so what
- Position
- Exactly?
Oh, hey, hey, that's
between me and my wife.
- Yeah. You - Know, that's, I
don't think it's appropriate.
- Yeah.
- And, and I, I think there's
something valuable in that.
I think there's something
valuable in us not knowing
how every, only because only
because politics is
inherently a polarizing thing.
And I think there's something
valuable in living in a
society where we go, I
don't know how you vote.
Let's go and vote honestly in privates
and then let's see what the country
and the people actually feel like.
And then we work from there.
Does that, does that make sense?
- No, it does, it does make sense.
And I think that when it comes to the Rock
or any other celebrity, there's
two main things at play.
One is that there's no way word for it,
but it's, it's basically
we want every great athlete
to be Muhammad Ali
because Muhammad Ali took
everything that he had as far
as like clout, as far
as fame and everything.
- Yeah. - And he put it towards
things that he believed in.
And he gave speeches and he
happened to be a great order.
And he happened to be, well, well read.
So it's like we kind of
got everything all at once.
But then you turn to the next
boxer, next to him. Right.
So second best boxer in the world.
And he's like, I punch,
that's really all I do. Right.
And that was, that was okay at that time.
Like Muhammad Ali was doing
all these big things that were
outside the arena of
- Sport. Yeah.
- And other, other boxers
were just sport. Right.
But I think that now,
and I mean, I am kind of
coming down on, on myself
and just the, the whole country,
we don't love to like read
or find these people.
So then it's kind of easier
to package them in people.
We are already watching.
Like you're already watching
WrestleMania more than you're
watching a debate about
Israel-Palestine with,
with two people who are experts
and on the history Yeah.
And the politics. So then if
the rock says something about
Israel Palestine, you're
more inclined to listen.
'cause you're already watching him.
- I hear what you're saying. But I think
what we should never
take for granted is the
power of embodiment.
This is a man who has come from nothing,
has worked really hard
physically and mentally,
and he's brought people together
and you know, he, he
exists in different worlds
and he, he is also a biracial
human being who's combined,
you know, America, but then
also this, this Samoan heritage.
And it's all these things.
Do you know what I mean?
So there's all these pieces
that that sort of come together
and I think that embodiment
makes people go, that is
what we want our country to represent.
Like one of the weirdest
thoughts I've had is I've,
I've gone, I sometimes
feel like America could do
with a royal family as well.
Like America should
actually get a royal family.
Because I sometimes think
what happens in America is
America's looking for the
embodiment of what America is
and they're putting that on the president.
But that job is really just supposed
to be like an administrative role.
You're the regional manager
and you manage a region called America.
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I think the royal family
and this idea of a
embodiment is a good one
because I think as much as embodiment,
I think there is a
certain type of American
and a certain type of Brit
who needs a public figure
that makes them feel like
the country is harmonious.
- Yes.
- And the royal family is a great example
because when I really, really
think about the royal family
and the fact that I speak with
this accent, it's a result
of trauma and pain.
You came to West Africa
and you plundered it, you
created Nigeria, you raped it,
and you put your face on our money.
And then the country's
in such a bad state.
My grandparents and people,
like my grandparents
and parents had to move
to a different country.
Right. And my, when my parents were born,
they were born under colonial rule.
This was, they were born
before Nigeria had become independent.
- Yeah.
- So for some British people
who can sing royal batan
and you can sing God, save the
Queen, and now God save the king.
When they see the royal family,
they do see that embodiment,
they see that fantasy of harmony.
But underneath it,
underneath these symbols,
wherever they are, whether it's
the rock or the royal family
or a president, there's
always something darker there.
Even the rock, he may
not show us his darkness,
but there is an inherent conflict in him.
But people want this fantasy
of embodiment and harmony.
And I think the rock is
actually the perfect example
because him saying, do you
know what I'm gonna shut up?
That does embody what a, a lot
of America is doing right now.
Where they're like, I'm just
gonna keep what I really think
to myself rather than be able
to live in the discomfort
and have the messy conversations.
- Okay. So let me ask you
about that question then.
Do you think that, do you think that
the idea of
cancel culture slash wokeness, like,
I mean like let's just use these terms
loosely and throw them around.
Right? We, we, 'cause we can
debate forever about, I mean,
I have my thoughts, you have
your thoughts, et cetera.
But do you think there could be some
merit to maybe having like a,
I, I know this sounds weird,
but maybe like an amnesty
where we say like everyone
can say what they want.
Let's like a purge. Everyone can say
what they want for one day.
Maybe let's say like every two months
or every three months, we
hold nothing against you.
But you can come out and say it.
And because then maybe
there's like a release valve.
'cause it seems like people might vote
a lot louder than they speak.
And that could be causing
a bit of a problem
because it surprises you when it happens.
- Okay. I'll pitch you that
that thing already exists
and exists all the time.
And it, and it goes by
anonymity on the internet.
I think that people are consistently
voicing everything that they think.
You think so behind an avatar.
Like I, I don't think that
there's, there's this story
that we tell ourselves so we
don't have to feel as bad later
that the internet got us all riled up
and made us do whatever this person,
as far as cancellation what, what
- Whatever thing is.
Yeah, yeah. I hear you.
- I think that by and large
everyone already felt that way
and then they just let it out.
- So I, I agree and I disagree.
I think the internet
creates an environment
where people are prone to let
out a part of what they think.
But it is not them. And it
is not how they fully think.
I think there are a lot
of people on the internet
who say things just because
it's what's happening
and people are going crazy.
There is a part of you that
is caught up in the moment
that isn't a representation of all of you.
Whether it's a collective fear,
whether it's a collective anger,
whether it's a collective joy.
- Yeah. - Sometimes a hundred
thousand people are storming
and they're terrified.
And you, you're there and
you're like, I'm also terrified.
But you weren't really as
afraid as, as maybe you,
you would've been on your
own. Does that make sense?
- Yes. - And I think what
the internet has done is it's
created an environment
where people express a part
of themselves that is welcomed
by the group and the mob.
And then what happens is,
because of the internet and
because of the platform
and the way it looks,
we are only exposed to
that in a collective.
- Yeah.
- Half the people
who are like racist on the internet.
And I know this is a strong
thing to say, I think half
of those people aren't
even like real life racist.
Like they just found a
place where they can go out
and say something that'll hurt someone
and then they, they they
sort of get to put it away.
- I'm in between both of you actually.
- Yeah.
- I think there's something to Josh saying
that the internet brings stuff out of you.
I think Trevor to your like
thought experiment of that day
where you can say whatever you want,
it's actually very hard in person
to say something really
degrading to a stranger.
Even if you're gonna say a bad thing,
you're not gonna say the
worst thing as you would
- Online. Yeah. I agree with you.
- And I think there is
something to like that in
between phase of like radical honesty,
but when you do it in person,
I think you're more careful.
'cause then you're just
seeing the person's physical
reaction and like most
people aren't sociopath.
If you see that you've said
something that's hurt someone,
you are gonna react to it and it
changes the whole interaction.
Whereas when you're on online
and you're just being super rude
and it's your lower self,
you don't actually have
to see the person on the
other side of the screen.
So to merger ideas, I
think there should be a day
where we can be radically transparent
and honest about politics.
But you have to do it across from the
table with someone, Ooh, I like this.
And sit in their reaction.
And from there that's
where it gets interesting.
- Everybody should say
how they really feel in punching distance.
- I like this. We should, we should create
this. We we create a safe
- Environment - Where once,
let's start with once a year.
- Yeah.
- Pilot program.
- Yeah.
- We bring everybody together.
So we bring those people
to the rock, face-to-face,
and we're like, here
he is, here is Dwayne.
Speak to him. Tell him
how you feel about him
and his, his politics
and his endorsements. Mr.
- Rock. Mr. Rock.

- Wow. We really talking.
- We're doing this, man. Man,
we're doing this. You happy?
Sound happy? Yes. Picture happy.
Everybody's happy. Alright.
Then the most important
question is, is Idris happy?
How you feeling? I'm feeling good.
I mean, I'm, I'm shocked
that you're, you're awake.
- You were in, you were in
LA a few days ago. I was.
I was in la Yeah. Less
than 48 hours ago. Okay.
I went, I went, I passed through London
to come to Abu Dhabi.
Right. I've been doing some miles,
bro. You really have some miles.
- Yeah.
- Do you, do you get, do you get
to go to the lounge now?
Yes. I mean,
but no, I, you know, honestly,
airports can be daunting.
I, I get, I'm not an anxious flyer,
but the airports are
anxious. Make me anxious.
- Wait, what? I don't Are
you being serious right
- Now?
Yeah. No, seriously. Airports
just, just too much going on.
It feels so fragile. It's
weird. You know, I would
- Feel the calmest if I saw
Idris Alba in an airport.
I'm not even joking. 'cause
you carry yourself in a way
where I'd be like, man,
everything's going bad.
And I'd look and be
like, is that Idris Alba?
Everything's gonna be okay. Y'all,
everything's gonna be okay.
This is what now with Trevor Noah,
you know, if you told me I would be
in Abu Dhabi.
Right. Just an hour away from Dubai
in a hotel room overlooking
what seems like a beautiful bay.
Also combined with like, I
don't know, an office block.
Speaking to Idris Alba,
I would've said to you,
this is probably a psychedelic
dream that you're having.
But that's exactly where I am chatting
to Idris Alba in Abu Dhabi and Oh yeah.
Be, before we jump into everything, man,
congratulations on the,
on the Saga Awards.
That was beautiful. Oh,
that was really beautiful coming from you.
No man, for real. That was
really, really Beau It was funny.
It was heartfelt. It was like a vibe. It
- Was Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, hold on, hold on,
hold. You just tell me I was funny.
- You know that you're
- Funny though. No, bro.
I mean, you know that you're funny. Okay.
So me and you having a laugh about fufu
or African stuff, you know, we laugh.
- Yeah. - Yeah. But to stand
up in front of the world like
that and do what you do.
I thought about you a lot actually.
'cause you have a very good
way of commanding a room.
Your comic timing is hilarious.
You go off the cuff and
come back onto, onto script.
I was thinking about Trevor.
I was trying to channel it.
No, man, you, you killed it. If,
- If you were channeling me,
I now see me differently.
I actually wanna see my whole life
channel through Idris Alba.
Now if you sing, you were doing
Trevor Noah. I'm like, damn.
- It was, nah - Man. For real.
It was a, what was it like?
I haven't seen you host
before, by the way.
- Yeah, I don't actually, I
wasn't meant to be hosting.
It just gave me more
segments than anyone else,
because I had won two awards one time.
They duped me. They said, no, no, no.
It's just a couple more links I'm
hosting. Yeah, you were hosting.
- It was, it was a beautiful
moment for me, man.
I think one, it was cool
to see something different.
Two, I loved the vibe in the room.
Like, you know, acting acting
is such a weird profession in
that from the outside acting seems
impervious to anything.
Right. You know what I mean? Yeah.
I'm sure you know what, what
I what I mean by this. Yeah.
You know, like a lot of
people out there will
see you as an actor.
They see anybody as an actor
and they go, oh, what a
great job. What a great life.
- Yeah.
- It's perfect. Nothing affects you.
You don't have the stress
that a normal person has.
- Yeah.
- And I noticed in the awards, you
and other actors spent a
lot of time talking about
what it was like going through
the strikes in Hollywood.
What it was like having
the industry shut down.
And I wondered, like, do those moments
make you rere realize
the fragility of the,
of the industry you're in? A
- Hundred percent.
- Yeah. - I mean, in terms of
strikes, you know, in terms
of workers rights.
'cause that's what it's
all about, right? Yeah.
It's like we're workers one
way or another of an industry.
We're called actors called
superstars called Ho.
But we're workers. Right? And, and,
and the rights of those
workers are fragile,
especially in a, an
industry that, you know,
is dominated by a few.
And what was interesting about
that room is that, I mean,
there was the biggest
names in the film industry
who all went through the
same thing, you know?
And it was a strike and it was
crippling, I think for all of us.
You know, we all, all the actors
in that room just realized
that, you know, we're
lucky to be working, lucky
to have the industry that we have,
and we have a union that
actually really fought
for some really important issues.
Was there, was there ever a moment
- In your life when you stopped?
I mean, fear is the wrong word,
but it's like, so maybe I'll,
I'll I'll try and explain this.
For people who aren't
aware, a lot of people know
that in acting, there's auditioning.
A lot of people know that in acting,
you don't know when you may
get your next role, et cetera.
But I think few people truly appreciate
how unpredictable it is.
You know, I, I wonder was,
has there ever been a moment
in your career when you felt
secure as Idris where you
are like, all right, no,
I'm, I'm, I'm good now.
Or is there always that thing,
that shadow behind you going,
like, you never know
Idris, you never know.
- Y you know, it's interesting
'cause when, when I did the Wire, okay.
The Wire was a four year
explosion of my life.
- Yeah.
- Before The Wire,
I was literally penniless
in, in New York City.
And after the while, I was arguably one
of the most famous black
actors, at least in, in America.
Right. Right. 'cause of my character,
stringer Bell, it was so celebrated.
And at that time, leaving The
Wire because I didn't know I
- Was gonna die in that.
I didn't know my character was gonna die.
So Wait, wait, wait. What do you mean
you didn't know he was gonna die?
- I didn't know my character was gonna die
until we got the episode.
- Wait for real?
- Yeah. Yeah. A hundred.
That's another story altogether.
But damn, it was tough love.
But at that time, I was flying high.
I mean, I could go anywhere.
Like people were comparing
me to Dens, you know?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You know,
I was only third season
in anyway, when it,
when it fell off very
quickly, very suddenly
I remember thinking, oh, I'm good.
I'm, I'm string a bell.
- Yeah.
- And that was a tough pill to swallow,
although I did work,
but it was not the same.
- You see, that's, that's
something I don't even think about.
Just my character dying.
Like when I'm, when I'm doing,
when I'm doing a hosting gig.
Yeah. When I'm doing comedy,
there's not even a moment
where I think to myself, yep.
Someone might surprise me
and tell me, Hey, Trevor,
after the next ad break,
you are no longer the host.
There's a whole, there's
a, there's a piano
that's gonna drop on your
head and you're gone.
- Yeah.
- That's,
- Yeah.
That was, it was a bit
like this, you know, that
you usually get your scripts,
you know, like two, three,
you know, in a row, they write them.
- Right.
- And I think the way I got it,
I got, I got episode seven.
I was like, oh, episode
seven, I got episode seven.
Where's eight? Can I
get eight? What's wrong?
You, you're not, not, you're not in eight.
What do you mean I'm not in eight? You
should read, you should read it.
That's how I kind of found out.
I was like, wait, whew,
stringer, stringer,
stringer stringer.
What? And it was crazy. It was like that.
That's how I found out. And to
your point, you know, it was,
it was scary.
Yeah. You have,
- I I I will say from
the outside, at least one
of the most amazing careers in that you,
you've played everything.
You play every one. You exist
everywhere. Doing everything.
Some people want you to be
Idris sba, the Action Star.
You know what I mean? But
then some people go, man,
Idris Elba can also be the,
the vulnerable love interest.
And then obviously, you
know, you are in Avengers.
You, you know, you, you're
out there conquering, fasting,
the Furious, et cetera.
I know that it wasn't
easy, but I wanna know how
and why you thought you could
play something more than the
industry wanted you to play.
Because if you're
successful as a gangster,
Hollywood goes, you're a gangster.
And it's not even like a negative thing.
Hollywood just goes, we
know that you can do this,
so you can do this, you do this.
- Mm mm
- You chose not to do that. Why?
- I think I learned early
on the power of, no.
Like, I, when I, when
I moved to America to,
to become an actor there, my
career in England wasn't bad.
It was good. You know, I
was How, how old were you when you moved?
I was probably about 25,
26 years old. Oh, damn.
- Okay. - And there was
this junction where I said,
I'm not gonna do what you
want me to do in England.
I'm gonna say no and I'm gonna
jump ship and go to America.
And the power of no was my liberator.
'cause in England there was
this definite glass ceiling.
You could see it coming.
You know, it was like,
you're gonna play one kind of role.
And in England it's a smaller market.
- Yeah. - Back then, going
to America was like, a what?
You go where my guy, you
all right. Stay here.
And so post The Wire, every role
that came my way was all gangsters.
- Yeah. - All of them, you
know, films, television.
And I had to say no.
But I was okay with saying no
because I thought, no,
I, I've got some range.
I need to be able to show that range.
And that's, that was definitely,
I dunno, it was, like I said,
it was a liberator for me
to be able to know that the
power of no is important.
- Yeah. But talk me
through some of the doubts.
You come from the uk
you're doing, you're doing decently there.
Right? As it is a small market,
but it's a robust market.
You know, once you're in, you're working,
you're doing things B, B,
C, you know, channel four,
whatever, you come to the us.
It wasn't an overnight thing
for you though, in the us, was it?
- No.
- No. I mean, the, the first two
or three years was just flatline.
- Because I've, I've heard rumors
of you working at like a comedy club.
I remember someone saying this once. Yeah.
They were like, I met
Idris at a comedy club.
And I was like, what do you mean you met
Idris, like doing standup?
They're like, no, no.
He was working the door.
- I wasn't doing standup. I
was standing up at the door.
That's what I was doing.
The original standup.
The original standup.
- Yeah. But, okay. So
talk, talk me through, so
what part of the career is this happening?
And so you've come to the us
- Yeah, I've come.
- Yeah.
- I, I had some savings.
- Yeah.
- My wife at the time I was
married, you know, we were young.
We were like, let's go
to America. Had savings.
I was like, power of, no,
this is great. We're out here.
I didn't work for two years.
Damn. Straight, damn, straight.
24 months, no money.
And my savings ran out
in the first six months.
And it was a SRUs.
So, you know, that's where
I started to DJ in New York.
I brought my records over, literally,
I shipped over six crates of records.
This is wild.
And I moved to New York 'cause
I couldn't afford New York.
I ended up in Jersey City.
And the rent much cheaper.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Bergen have whatever
I reinvented, bro.
I was, it was one of these
moments where it's like, you,
you have to dig in or you are going home.
- Yeah. But you, you didn't
think of going home six months
in eight months, in 12
months, in 16 months in.
No. What, what's, what
is keeping you from going
home during that mo?
Like, what is, what is the
motivating force in your life
that didn't allow you
to give up? I'm trying to understand that.
- I think it was, you know,
I, I jumped the ship, man.
Like, I had done something,
no English, no black actor, no
young man had done that I
knew, which is, I'm gonna go
to America and I'm gonna, I'm
gonna be an actor over here.
And I couldn't take the
idea of letting that fail.
I just couldn't, I did
not want that to fail.
And I was auditioning for a lot of them,
but my accent wasn't very good.
I couldn't really, you know, pull it off.
- How did you get the accent? Good.
- Well, - Because you, you
have one of the best accents.
Your accent is so good.
Oh, I've seen people get angry
when they discovered
that you're not American.
I've seen people get really,
like, not even angry.
Like they angry that you
could fool them to that level.
- Yeah. No, I've, I've been
in those conversations.
Like, I think the way I got,
'cause I was, I was unemployed bro.
And I was living in New Jersey.
I lived in Brooklyn for a little bit.
I was living life, you know,
I was working the door,
I was bartending, I was door DJing.
And before you know it, you
just start speaking like an
American, because you end up
saying you're in the ting.
You're in the ting.
And then, you know, third
year in though, it started
to get really struggled.
'cause my wife and I were
going through some stuff.
She was pregnant. And
there's one casting director,
I talk about it all the time.
Alexa Fogel. She would
put me up for stuff.
And she said, Hey, listen.
Ah, this wire thing's come up.
It's called The Wire. It's a pilot.
They're gonna shoot it in January.
But if you go in,
you cannot let them know
you aren't American.
'cause they will not, I mean,
this is about Baltimore.
It's very specific. They
don't want any strangers.
I mean, please.
So I was auditioning for this thing,
and I auditioned for
four weeks straight in
an American accent.
And then the fourth audition, you know,
and the producer, David Simon
and another producer who's,
who's passed now, great guy.
They're in the room just like this.
And they said to me,
Iris, where are you from?
- That is the phrase, every
immigrant is terrified
of hearing no matter where
they are in the world.
Excuse me. Where are you
- From?
You know when your palm
palms start sweating? Yeah.
Little sweat preparations in your forage.
And you're like, oh man.
And I'm thinking to myself,
they told you, don't say nothing.
- Yeah. - And I'm thinking,
oh, your accent is shit.
Oh, you substitute. And I was
like, I'm looking at me by,
by this time I've known
him just for audition.
- Yeah.
- Hey, you just come on, sit down.
We don't you to do the scene again.
You know, that kind of thing.
I look at him and I said, I,
I'm from East London,
the room just exploded.
Oh my God. I told you no, you didn't know.
You didn't know they. And
I'm sitting there, whoa,
what, what is going on?
It was like, yo, we had a bet.
I told, I said that
He's not from Baltimore.
He's not from Brooklyn,
he's from somewhere else.
But I thought, maybe
Jamaican. Maybe Haitian.
You're from England. And
this is the conversation.
I'm sitting there and they were
like, okay, you got the job.
You got the job. We, we,
we don't want you to play Avon though.
We want you to play stringer
belt. And I, and I was in the room.
- Oh, mess. So you in for Avon?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. You got the job.
I'll tell Alexa, welcome. Thank you.
But wow, you owe me money.
I'm walking outta the room.
Like, did my life just change?
I don't know what's going on.
And that was it. That was,
- That's the way I got that film.
You see, that's, that's what
I mean about serendipitous.
Like, I love moments like
that where now I'm trying
to picture the show with you as Ava.
It doesn't work in my
head. It's different.
It might have worked, it might not.
You, you, you, but you know what I mean?
- Yeah.
- It's
- Just like these, these stories.
I love that phrase though.
Like, where are you from? Yeah.
Because in a way, what you said is, is is
so much deeper than, than
just you putting on an accent.
- Mm.
- You lived as an American.
Do you know what I'm
saying? I, I, I don't think
that's any coincidence.
I the fact that you were grinding the fact
that you were working
multiple jobs, the fact
that you didn't know what
was gonna happen from one
paycheck to the next.
The fact that you were,
you know, in barber shops
and in comedy clubs and working the bar
and DJing in, in a, in a
really strange way, both sad
and beautiful at the same time.
The facts, you were living as an American.
- Oh yeah. The, the, the time
that I knew I was American
is when I had to go
to the DMV to get my license.
Okay bro. Like, if anyone knows
what that is, that is like,
oh my days.
That was one of the most,
as soon as I had my life,
I was like, yes.
You can't tell me none. Because the
- Process,
- That's the wild, the process was crazy
- And Oh, no, no.
It's, that's, that's a,
that's a rites of passage.
I feel like you have not lived
in America until you've gone
to the DMV in America.
We're gonna continue
this conversation right
after this short break.
But, but like, but let's
talk a little bit about that.
Like, where you from, you know, there's a,
there's a special connection.
I always feel with people who
have moved from one place,
especially the place they were born
and lived to another place to try
and do something that requires
them to ingratiate themselves
to the people of that place.
- You
- Know, I, I obviously started my
career in South Africa.
South Africa's very similar to the UK in
that we have a small
industry, but it works.
It's robust, you know, and
you do the little that you can
and you, you do it in the
world that they allow you to do it.
In going to America was
ridiculous in my world.
People literally were like,
what are you doing? Why?
Like, why, why America?
- Mm. - You know? And and what
would you say about America?
Well, well, well, yeah.
You see, my thing was,
I was never going for America.
I dunno if you can relate to this,
but when I, when I look at
anything that I'm doing,
I try to do it to the best of my ability
and almost to the end of
what it is supposed to be.
- Right.
- So if I'm doing comedy, I do my best.
I toured everywhere in South Africa.
I started touring in Southern Africa.
So I was in Namibia, I was
in Zambia, I was in Botswana.
I was doing my comedy everywhere.
The natural extension
of that comedy is going
to America, right?
Because if you want to be one
of the best comedians in the world,
you cannot do it without
performing at the top
stages. At that level, at the top levels.
- Yeah. - I was already
performing in the uk, you know,
I was doing shows in everywhere
from London to Brighton,
Newcastle, Liverpool, you name it.
Circuit. Yeah. I've been,
I've been there. You know.
Oh, you're not, you're
not bad, are you, mate?
You know what I mean?
I've, I've been there,
I've been, I was doing it.
But the US comes with a, with
a different type of pressure,
with a different type of landscape.
And so I went, I need to
go and try this there.
And it wasn't about like the
bright Lights of America,
it was about the natural
progression of my, of my career.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- But then just like you,
you now move into a new
place where people go,
you sound funny.
You don't say like, I
remember when, when I was,
when I was first hosting
the Daily Show, no joke.
I thought one of the biggest
complaints we'd get would be
about my view on America,
or my politics or whatever.
The biggest complaint I got was about
how I say the word controversy
and then complaint.
Yeah. There was like a
big, we, we got letters.
We got letters daily.
And the producer sat me down at some point
and they were like, Hey, Trav.
So there are some words that you say,
it's throwing people off a
little bit and we understand it.
But is there a way you
could find a middle ground?
Is there, do, do, do you know what I mean?
I had to relearn so many words.
Just because you're trying to
work within the space. Yeah.
You know, and, and in a
weird way, it then starts
to redefine who are you?
- Yeah. And you are someone else when I
wouldn't say you're someone else.
Right. Because you always
take your roots with you.
If you're rooted. If you're
- A rooted person,
- You take that with you.
Right. But a adaptation
definitely. You know? Yeah.
And I, and I think that's,
it's not for everyone, you
- Know, like Yeah.
There's new parts of you definitely. A
- Hundred percent.
You know, it's kind of like, I had
what I call an accent crisis.
I had a crisis of accent.
'cause when I came out of the wire,
and, you know, if I was going to a party
or whatever, I was doing
an interview or something,
and I talked the way I
talked, they'd be like, yo,
why are you talking like that man?
No, for real though. Why?
What you doing a part?
What you doing man? And you
like, you're like, you try
to figure out if you want friction.
Right? That's how I talk.
No, seriously. Yeah.
They would almost feel
like, yo, you, you, you,
you got me, man.
Like, yeah, you string a bell.
You come from this. Yeah.
And 'cause of the wire
especially was not a satire.
These were based on a real
culture, real epidemic,
if you like, of American underbelly.
They took to my characters,
to the point where I had
to hold myself Idris a
certain way in definitely
amongst the African American community.
- Right.
- I had to hold myself with the, the sort
of respect almost they
had for string a bell.
- Yeah.
- Which was a man trying to do good. Yeah.
A man trying to do better
than he was, you know,
being prescribed to do.
Wow. And that really was interesting.
What that did to me as a did
for my confidence, did for my,
when I went back to England,
going back to England
and people were like, yo, why
are you talking like that?
And I just found myself, you know,
when you know you're your England
or in South Africa, Americans
come over, they just got so much
- Confidence. Yeah, yeah,
- Yeah.
Bigger and brasher and Yeah.
You know, and they, and,
and they got that diff
they believed they got
that different, and I went
back to England and I,
and I definitely felt like,
oh wow, I have adapted myself.
Even when I was in my mom
and dad's household with my
boys, they were like, yo, you,
you seem a bit different.
You seem a bit happier. You
- Seem a little more enthusiastic.
That's one thing I've
learned about the uk.
There's a little bit of like,
alright, all right then.
Alright, then turn it down
a bit. Relax, slow it down.
Oh yeah, yeah. Relax.
You're doing all, you're doing alright.
Yeah. It wasn't, it wasn't
bad. Wasn't not, yeah.
It wasn't bad. Yeah. Humble.
- It's, it's the tall poppy syndrome.
- It really is.
- I think that's part
of the reasons why I didn't audition well.
Because I couldn't walk in there
and be like, bow, this should be mine.
They'd be like, oh, Idris,
that was a good take.
Can you do another one? I'd
be like, oh, did you like it?
Oh, great. Okay. I, I'll try again then.
Oh wait, the other guy like,
you like that. Okay, hold up.
Wait till you see this one.
- You know, that wasn't
me. You know, it's funny,
culturally, I remember when
I first started doing standup
comedy in the us the,
you, you understand this,
in America, they would have
what they call the urban rooms
And then rooms.
Right. What that means is these are rooms
where black people watch black comedy.
And then the rest of the rooms are just,
I guess, regular comedy.
I always found that weird. 'cause I've,
I come from a country
that's predominantly black
and we never looked at it like that.
So anyway, they go, you know,
people would be like, oh,
you gotta go perform in urban rooms.
Go and do some urban rooms.
And so I get to these urban rooms
and you know, it's black
comedians, black audiences.
And I would get on stage
and in South Africa, number
one, Africa, you greet.
So I'd walk out, I'd greet
the audience, good evening,
everybody, you know?
And that audience would stare at me.
And I remember after one of the shows, one
of my favorite people in
the world, his name is,
his name's Chris Spencer,
comedian, really like a,
like a like a mentor to me in the game.
He came to me after one of the shows
and he's like, he's like, Hey man.
He's like, did you steal something?
And I said, what do you mean?
He's like, he's like, man,
you walk on stage like
you stole something.
He's like, man, you gotta get on there.
You gotta own that stage, baby, man.
You walking on there like,
like you ain't supposed to be there.
You start making the audience
doubt themselves, man.
They be looking at you like
you supposed to be there.
We don't feel like you're
supposed to be there.
He's like, man, you gotta get up there.
And I was like, well,
that's not how we do.
He's like, well, that's how we do it baby.
He's like, you gotta understand.
He's like half so true.
He's like half those
people in the audience.
They're funnier than you.
They know they're funnier than you.
So you better show them why you up there.
You better show them why you're up there.
And he like, it was a
beautiful way, you know,
when you connect those things, you, you,
you know, you, you find
- That's funny.
- I, I'd love to know like,
you know, in that, what is it
that's inspired you
to connect all of these parts of yourself?
Because you, you, you're
not just Idris Alba,
the movie star in Hollywood.
I've always loved how you
have bigged up the UK at every
opportunity that you've been given.
You've also big up
African Americans at every
opportunity you've been given.
You've, you've, you've
adopted these communities.
And one that always touches
me, obviously is Africa.
Idris Alba doesn't like wave
at Africa from far, my man,
your passport is stamped,
your passport is full
of full jo of
- Rice.
You was gonna say that.
Oh no, it's full, full, full.
Do you know, so two things
that were quite significant, right?
To, I guess who I am today is one, my mom
told me that her, my
mom was born in Ghana.
- Yeah.
- Okay. Her mom has gone in,
but her dad was a second World war vet
from Kansas City.
And on his deployment back
to the states, he heard
that yo segregation over
here is still kicking it.
I mean, in the army, you
know, there was segregation,
but everyone was fighting for each other.
Right. Soldiers were
going back to the states
and told you can't come in the restaurant.
- Yeah.
- So he said he
and his brother decided
they're gonna go to Africa.
They went to Ghana and that's
where he had 11 children.
My mom being the ninth, the last one. Wow.
So that information came to me just
before I then went to America.
And I kind of went with a
slightly different purpose.
I was kind of like, oh, wait, what?
Oh, I've got roots here.
Then I, I mean, I belong here
kind of thing, right? Yeah.
The second thing is that I, at
some point in my later life,
I, I was probably about 29
or so, I took my DNA test.
I knew my mom had a American father,
but my dad's from Sierra
Leone, very proud.
Sierra Leone, Ghana. DNA.
No, Sierra Leonian. Wait, what?
No, 10% Ghana, 10% Nigerian, 20% Bantu,
25% Togo, 5% Senegalese, Cameroonian.
I mean, it was a map, right?
I looked at this thing
like, what is going on?
Bantu being the south
southern African tribe. Yeah.
That's, that's my, my side of the world
that traveled up Prince.
Huh. So I looked at this thing, right?
And I was like, what the took it again?
Same thing. You took it again. Yeah,
- I
- Did.
I I was like,
- I, sorry.
I always find it funny when
people do the same thing twice,
hoping for a different result.
I don't know why I find
that so funny. DNA test.
But I love the idea that you're like, hold
on, hold on, let's try this again.
You, and then you're like,
and this time I'm going
to push certain puzzle myself.
I'm gonna bring out certain parcel myself.
- I ate before I took it.
I, I jo I was like, no,
hold on. I've got, what
- Were you hoping to get the second time
- Round?
Well, my mom said to me,
I told her about this.
She said, ah, Kuna k Kuna,
that is all money making you.
How much would you pay?
How much would you pay?
I told her, she like, you see, to come
and tell you that you're
not from Sierra Leon,
your dad is from Sierra
Leon, your mom is from Ghana.
I'm like, yeah, but mom,
scientifically, you know,
like, that's not how it works.
Una una listen. Anyway, so I did it again.
I didn't even tell her the
results the second time around.
But this is, this was me
and I just found myself like,
not questioning, but I was like, wow.
I'm, I'm African.
- Yeah man.
- I am from this continent.
And it also reminded me that
everywhere I go in Africa,
probably a bit like you too.
Right? People claim you.
Yeah. Ah, in beautiful way.
Ah, they claim you. Yeah.
You know what I'm saying?
You are resident now. You know
what I mean? Wherever I go.
And I just, I guess I adopted that.
So now as a, you know,
I'm in the public eye
and people, you know, talk
to me about where I'm from.
I have a real rich
backstory. It's beautiful.
I'm talk about my granddad.
I can talk about my, my,
my, you know, Freetown,
Sierra Leone was the home
of the return slaves.
No wonder, no wonder my
DNA doesn't say Yeah,
Freetown Sierra Leone
because my, my dad's DNA
is probably mixed from
so many different types of tribes.
You know? So, so that has been the very
feeling I have every time I open my
mouth about where I'm from.
- Yeah. - I'm from England.
I was born and raised there.
I'm proud of that. But out
of that comes this sort of,
I I'm an explorer, you know,
I'm an explorer of myself.
I'm an explorer of the
cultures that I'm from
and I've been, I remember, man, I,
I think we talked about this,
but when I got to play Nelson Mandela
- Oh yeah. Yeah.
- Do you know when it hit
the news in South Africa,
it was polarizing.
People are like, this guy can't play.
He's obviously West African.
What are you talking about?
He's not closer. How's he doing?
Yeah. Yeah. Play Nelson. Okay.
He's tall, but what are you joking? Like?
And others were like, no, fantastic.
They got a Hollywood
actor to play a great man.
Right, right. It was just really,
and I, I remember thinking, wow.
I never really thought about
it until, well, no, look, no.
At the time I said, dude, this
is the first thing I said.
I said, Nelson's light-skinned.
My agent is South African.
He's like, it just, it just,
it just, it just listen.
Don't ever repeat that. Okay.
Don't, just don't, just don't repeat that.
I was like, no, but seriously
man, what are gonna say?
Like, what is South Africans gonna say?
And then he said to me,
remember when you took your
DNA test, what happened?
I went, yeah, you're African baby.
You're African and so is Nelson.
So just go and kick the
shit outta this role.
- Right.
- And I remember doing this one scene.
It was in Soweto
and it was one of the scenes
when Nelson was a lawyer.
Beginnings of his rallying, you know,
and for the, for the a NC and a NC.
Yeah. Really early parts.
And he was in Soweto, beautiful
suit lawyer, the part in,
you know, boxer radical guy,
you know, small sua of guy.
And the director did not want
me to come out and rehearse.
He just wanted me to be ready.
He had four cameras, 700
extras in just you coming
out Soto. You know what what I mean
- Young
- People. But,
- So he wants you to come
out and just do the speech
as if you were doing the speech.
Exactly. There is no
doing a speech twice and
- We're gonna shoot it.
Yeah. I just wanna see what happens.
I was back there like this boy,
oh my God, I'm gonna get booed.
I'm gonna get booed. It was almost exactly
what Nelson probably had
to go through at the time.
- Oh yeah.
- Which is, who's this guy,
this lawyer coming out
here talking all this shit?
Is it crazy? I came out there,
man, first thing I heard,
I even heard someone say,
is that string up there,
that doing up there.
Right. Another one said,
that's the guy from Daddy's little girls.
I could hear them. They
were, I was, that is
so doing my speech.
So everyone knows everything
you've been in. Yeah.
But he says how he's playing
madiba first take mind
you, they're staring at me.
And this is exactly what,
because at the Times Soweto was like, boy,
we're not sure if we're gonna,
there was people listening.
They're like, are we gonna stand for this?
Stand with this guy? 'cause this guy is
trying to get us all in trouble.
He is talking some radical shit.
- Yeah.
- And here I was out here playing Nelson
dark as you can get, hitting the accent,
hitting the notes, hitting the beats.
And, and I never forget about it
because it's quite
emotional rousing speech.
By the end of the, the first
tape, man, I was in tears,
practically the first five rows
of people in tears with me.
And we're talking about freeing Africans.
- Yeah.
- From the bullshit, freeing them.
And man, it was like,
it was just the craziest
mishmash of all of it.
You know, me as an actor, who am I?
Where am I from? Should I be here?
Do I have the right to play the big man?
Then this young, these
young people who know Idris,
who have celebrated Idriss
career are watching me polarized
by Can he pull off Maddis?
- Yeah. - And then of course,
slowly growing into it
with you slowly grow into
it with me at the same time,
Maddis at the time,
slowly winning the people
over the community over into
his rhetoric.
So it was a fascinating man.
So it's quite how you,
how do you, how you, how
- Did you keep, because
Nelson Mandela has one
of the most difficult accents to pull off.
Yeah. How do you, how
did you keep that in the,
can you still do it till this day?
'cause you have so many accents.
You have like different English accents.
You've got different American accents.
You've got at the SAG awards.
I, I don't know
where you pulled out a Robert De
Niro from, I'm not even joking.
That was one of the most impressive world.
'cause when, when you started,
I was like, well, you
can't do Robert Dero.
You, you're massive. It's
like, look at your size.
Look at Robert de yo, you
became Robert De Niro.
You even became a little
lighter. I dunno how you did it.
Like your skin tone changed.
You became lighter, you became smaller.
I'm not even, yo, that was
good. I'll take you that.
I'll that No, but I'll be for real though.
How do you, how long do you
hold onto them for like, how do,
do you, do you keep them forever
or do they like slip in time?
- It's funny when you
said earlier you have one
of the best American accents.
Like, I disagree. I, I'm, if
I'm in a role, I'm in a role.
And at that time I can do it
because I guess I've gotta live it.
- Yeah, yeah.
- As close to the honesty of it as I can.
But if you ask me to do
it now, if you ask me
to do mad deep now it
sound like an impression.
- Oh, that makes can't, okay. Okay.
- I can't, like, even when
I'm just joking around
and doing American accents,
I just, they're not on point.
- Because it's not the exact same.
- Not the same thing. But 'cause
- Well, Nelson, I find I, I
never lose my Nelson Mandela.
I always, I just, I like, there'll be days
where I just do it for no reason.
I'm, I'm being serious.
I'll literally just like be
walking around in my room.
Just kidding. And I'll
just be like, never forgot
Boss Purple.
It's just like, it's
in the, I actually use,
I use my Nelson Mandela
to get to my Barack Obama.
- Okay.
- Because I find they have the same,
my conspiracy theory
is that Mandela taught
Obama how to do it.
Because the cadence,
they got the same. Yeah.
Because they got the same
thing. 'cause like, you know,
because Mandela has the hyper
lift all South Africans.
Oh, must fight for this country
has got that thing. Right.
And then Barack, if you
take, it's a natural,
it's the natural
progression of that Right.
Hyper lift where can come pro.
And as Americans, we
gotta try to, you know,
it's a stronger voice.
It has a lot of, but when,
whenever I lose it, I have to go back
to Mandela 'cause of Man Mandela.
You know? Know what I
mean? Right, right, right.
As Americans, as Americans,
we gotta find our way
to believe in ourselves.
It's the same
- Likes in there.
I'm fighting every impulse
to challenge you to a Barack
and a Mandela right now. Why don't we
- Do it?
No, because, because
what, what's gonna happen?
Because you're just gonna murder
me. I don't believe that. That's
- True.
- I don't believe that. That's
- True.
- Do you, do you Mandela I'll even like,
it'll be like a harmony,
- Trevor,
- When you are doing
- Mandela, there's got to be
a very, you, you see you killing him.
This guy just pulled it out. But
- When it's Barack,
- There's gotta be
a No. That's terrible.
- No, but you barak you know
why? 'cause you, you, you, because I
- I took it up.
- Yeah. No, chesty chesty Barak
is also, he's also through.
But Yo Mandel, that was flawless.
I was almost doing like Mandela,
like you hear him on the
radio under broadcast.
Yes. Mandela pitches up.
Yes, he does pitch up.
Yeah. It's, it's funny you
say the thing about like,
knowing yourself and
the pieces of yourself.
I I I, I wonder if
that's what's made you
such an amazing actor, is
that like you have been forced
in life to discover the parts
of yourself as a real character
that makes you who you are.
- Yeah. - Do you know what
I mean? And I feel like all
great actors will tell you that they have
to know all the parts that make
the character who they are.
- Hmm. - What would you say
you've brought from your
life into acting?
And what would you say that
acting has brought into your
life the other way around?
- I, I would say that in the,
the maturity of any actor.
Unless, unless you're a child actor
and you win out your first
audition and you're a star.
- Yeah. - But the maturity of
an actor is a patient game.
You know, you kiss a lot of
frogs, a lot of auditions. Hmm.
Lot of nos before you get that. Yes. Okay.
Lot of rejection. Hmm.
I've had some really
challenging moments in my life,
and I definitely know as an actor,
we have to have thick skin.
You have to go through some stuff
that actually is traumatizing for you.
Right. You know, when you
play a role like Luther
for example, he sees a lot of
murder, destruction, blabla.
I go in, I play that role,
and I play it to all of my ability.
But my body doesn't
actually know I'm acting.
That's the thing people take
for granted, I think. Right.
You know, so when I'm crying
or the trauma, or I'm yelling,
or I'm, my head's about to blo explode.
It's great acting. It's great.
But actually my body doesn't know the
difference. What do you
- Do to get back to Idris
and how do you work on releasing
that from you as a person?
- At first thing is to acknowledge that
you know, you're acting bro.
- Yeah. - It's not real. Go
do something for yourself.
Go yourself. Good. Go. Oh,
nice. Take some therapy. Like,
- Okay.
- All of that has helped
me become, I think,
a better human being.
Because I, I know my bo I, I'm
so dedicated to my characters.
Yeah. That I, I know I need
to be dedicated to Idris
as well, which is where the
DJing, where the, you know,
the philanthropy where,
you know the, oh, I love
that. Other parts come.
- So that's all, that's all for you.
- Yeah. That,
- That's you. Because I've seen people ask
many times, they will say,
what are you doing, man?
You've worked so hard
to climb the mountain.
That is Hollywood. You have
broken through so many barriers.
And then mans turns
around and says he's a DJ
and he's making music
and he's taking a step
back from acting. And he's
- Mm.
- But I've seen you on the decks.
You are having the time of your life.
- Mm. - But I didn't know that
you were doing it for you.
I, I thought, I thought you were looking
for another challenge or another
thing. But this, that's like
- You, it's I need it.
I need the balance.
I need the, the natural
juices that come from that.
- What, what is it, what is it
about DJing in in particular?
- It's, I used to dj, so I wanna
know what you, for me it's,
there's a really beautiful
energy sweet point.
Right. It's like when you make some,
when you make a whole room
laugh with one gesture.
- Yeah.
- That absolute pinnacle moment is an
energy that you can't replicate.
And it's like when you
mix two songs together
and the crowd go, ah, that you can't,
I can't get that from acting.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.
- You know, so, but when you
dj you do anything like that,
that feel, that feeling is real.
And that energy that I get from doing
that is like rejuvenating.
It's like, that's the
stuff, that's the stuff my
batteries are really made of.
You know what I'm saying? So
I do it for the, I do those,
I do all these different
things for therapy.
Yeah. Because I really do
commitment to my roles.
You know what I mean? In a
way that my body doesn't know.
- How long have you been been
DJing for? When did you start?
- I started when I was 13.
- 13.
- 13. Yeah.
- On like actual, that's actual records,
- Right?
Actual DJing. Yeah. That's
actual, actual old school.
I was there when sort of hiphop kind of
- Began. What were you like? Hiphop?
- Hiphop was 50, 50
- Years.
- So I was kind of there
in the UK buying records,
the first hip hop records.
Like, yo, what is this sound? Yeah.
- What, what were your
decks? Were you like sl 12
hundreds? What were you using back then?
- No man. No Citro belt
drive. Oh my goodness.
You know the, oh my goodness.
- That's where you have to, you have
to let the vinyl go at the right speed.
Otherwise it's like, I love
it when you call me big rah.
You gotta, you gotta be so careful
with those when you let them go. Oh, bad.
- And the needle's like, really?
- Oh, it's always ready
to skip. Always ready.
Did you ever play gigs
where you would put the,
you put the needle on the record?
Yeah. And then someone bumps something
or the crowd like jumps
and then you playing.
It's going well, it's going well.
Everyone's having a good time.
Jump around, jump, jump, jump, jump.
And the crowd looks at
you like, you did it now.
'cause the, oh man, those were the days.
- Those were really the days. I forgot
you DJ'ed You told me.
How long have you been DJing?
- So I DJ'ed for, oh goodness.
I started straight off,
straight off to high school.
I, I was making music on
a pc, so I was playing
with everything from Yeah.
From mixing the music to Fruity Loops
and, you know, pro tools
and trying to play around with that stuff.
A friend saw me doing it.
He said, yo, you should
come and DJ for people.
I was like, I don't do
that. He said, no, you do.
Just, just come and do
it. And I would sit there.
Yo, when I tell you I
was the biggest nerd,
I would come there with a full PC rig.
It's not sexy. Like now with a laptop
and you've got your no peace.
I'm talking like a full
on, you remember like the,
that cream colored Yeah.
Screen with the big
plastic. Yeah. Yeah. The big
- Box. Yeah.
- I've come there looking like I'm about
to set up somebody's network.
I put that stuff down.
This is in the hood, by the
way, proper in the hood.
And people are looking at me
and they, and people would come
and be like, sorry, where's, who's the dj?
And I'm like, I'm the dj.
And they go, where's, where's
your, where's your 10 table?
And I said, no, I use a computer.
And they're like, for
music? And I was like, yeah.
And you could see their faces go like, oh,
this is not gonna end well.
This is not gonna end well. Yo.
And then I would play that, that was me.
And I would just sit there mixing songs
for like six hours live.
Really? Yeah. Because you could have
that much music and I
would play everything.
I would go, you'd start
off with like, you know,
I'd start off with like slow BPMs.
I'd be in like the seventies,
eighties warming things up.
It'd be like jagged edge and all of that.
Get to like 94 bpm, move things up.
- Okay.
- Yeah. And then at some point I'd
like warm it up, warm it up.
We get to like hip hop midnight,
we'd start playing house.
Yeah. Try and get to like
one 20 bpm, you know,
get people moving and then you bring
it back down on the other side.
I love, I loved it. I loved it. What
- Was your DJ name?
- I did, I never got one.
- Okay.
- What was yours? N Knuckles nickname was,
- Nah, so, so it started off
as my mom gave me this one.
Your mom gave you a DJ
name? Yeah, it was Eriko.
Oh, that's not bad actually.
Eriko. That's not bad.
Really? I don't, that's
- Bad.
- Because I used to play for my
parents whenever they had parties.
Yeah. And playing record
- Eriko.
I don't think that's bad at all.
I thought you were gonna
be like dj. Cute boy.
No, dj my special child.
I thought it would be something
like, I don't think of an
African mom, but Eriko Wass Dope.
- Eriko was the first one.
And then it went from that
to Kipling. Mr. Kipling.
- Ah, Mr. Kipling.
- Yeah. Mr.
- Kipling. I like that.
- Kippers.
- What? Do you have one now?
- No, it's just Idris.
- Just Idris is a nice one.
- No, just, just Idris.
- Yeah, just Idris is a great DJ name.
It's just Idris on the decks. I like that.
- No, no, no. Idris you're saying just
Idris. Just, just saying.
- Yeah. Just Iris.
- Yeah.
- Don't go anywhere. 'cause we got more.
What now after this,
we got Idris, the actor Idris, the DJ
Idris the, i I, I say this,
and I don't say this lightly.
I think the world builder,
- You, - You have a, you
have a statesman vibe to you.
And I've, I've seen you with
people like you, you want
to create, you wanna
build, you want to grow.
Like, when you look at the
world you're in now, first
of all, where do you,
where do you see the states
of Hollywood and acting and, and content
and everything right now?
Because it's definitely changing.
- Mm.
- You can't deny it. I mean,
some would even argue you're
the last, you know, the last
of the, of the superstars
of like the real Hollywood,
you know, it's No, no, really,
it's, it's, it's changing.
I think it's becoming a lot more niche.
And, and you could see at
the SAG awards people talking
about this, people saying, you
know, I, I played this role.
I got to do that. This
is what my dream was.
This is how I am. I got to
do this for the first time.
I got to play this type of character
when nobody said I could.
What excites you about
the industry right now?
And and where do you still
wanna see the industry
grow, grow and change?
- You know, the,
our industry has taken on
incredible change shape
shifting over the last, I'd say 10 years.
And it sort of, sort
of began really slowly
with this conversation
around diversity, around
our societies, looking like
the TV shows we were watching
and seeing that it wasn't,
and then peeling the
onion back even further
and seeing that there wasn't
very much equality within it,
behind the scenes.
So, you know, the sort of gender
debate Yeah.
Springing into action.
Me too. And all this.
So over the last 10 years,
we've seen an industry
that's gone through, I think
a very healthy health check.
You know what I mean? Checking
itself, you know what I'm saying?
There's a history that
essentially rewarded people
for bad behavior.
Suddenly said enough of
that in a healthy way. Okay.
Alongside that though, came this sort
of interesting expansion
with the digital era.
Just more, you know, I
mean, I come from a period
where in England there's
four or five channels.
- Yeah.
- Okay. And you watched one of those five.
That was it. That was it. You
were lucky if you got cable
or Sky tv.
Okay. You were lucky. And
then we're in an era now
where you literally can watch
anything from anywhere in the
world on your phone.
- Yeah.
- And what that's done
for our industry is expanded it,
but also somehow
restricted it a little bit
because the metrics of
how you get a show made now are different.
- Yeah.
- You know what I'm saying?
It's like, I think that you,
to your point, you know, there,
there's, there's niche micro Yeah.
It, it seems like it's groups
that started to emerge now.
So it's very rare now to
have one actor be a star
or an entire generation.
Yeah. That's, you know, weirdly enough,
I feel like Africa is,
you know, the continent
of Africa still has the opportunity
to have the most incredible movie film
industry in the world.
- Your eyes light up when
you say that. Oh yeah, man.
For real. Your eyes.
- Yeah.
- I feel like you wanna
be at the forefront of that.
- I, I wanna be at the foundation of it.
We want Trevors, we want irises,
and we want them to be the
biggest stars they can be.
Because in that part of the world,
we haven't had that opportunity.
There's 1.4 billion people
there and there's 4,000 cinemas.
What, How are we getting our stories?
You know, I think about
our industry with a sort
of opto futurist perspective.
Hmm. Because as much as I've worked gladly
for 30, 35 years in, you know, in America
and England, I've had most
incredible opportunities.
And Korea, I still think
I've got more to offer.
And when I think about
Africa, you know, when we saw
what happened with the Black Panther
and the sort of
Afrofuturism world was sort
of really exploding.
Everyone was like, whoa,
whoa. What is this?
This is incredible.
That was a moment where
you're saying, yeah, you know,
it albeit Marvel.
But it was a moment where
the world sort of stood up
and was like, oh, wait a second.
There's, there's African superstars.
- What? Yeah. Yeah.
- Wait, there's African sci-fi. What?
And just imagine what
that could do, you know?
And it does make me excited.
- W what what's your dream?
I I ask everyone on the podcast What now?
Because I find whenever I meet people,
they're always at an inflection point.
Something's about to happen
or something has happened
and now they're moving on, or they're
thinking of the next step.
You are constantly moving
towards the next step, you know?
And, and in a really peaceful
way, I might add, you know,
it's, it's always been fun to watch the
way, the way you move.
You seem both grateful
and also still hungry, which is a,
which is a hard balance to find.
So, so what now what do
you dream of in your world?
You know, if you could, if you
could wave your magic wand,
what would Idris be doing
for the next decade?
- If I could wave my magic
wand, it would be, I would
be part of it.
The African film industry's growth.
- Yeah.
- Seeing studios,
seeing African streaming
companies, seeing producers,
you know, live on the international stage
while bringing collaborators
into the continent.
I love that. As well as col
sending out stories internationally.
You know, that would be, I would sit as a
performer, as a director,
as a producer, as a,
a vessel in that, you know, in that dream.
I love that. That's what I
would do. I mean, you know, I'm,
I, I I really appreciate your words, man,
because you say quietly, and
I take that to mean humbly.
You know, I'm humbly appreciative
of the opportunities I have.
I'm humbly respectful that
I've been invited to this opia
to come and talk about this dream
and that I could possibly
raise some partnerships for it.
So it's an exciting time.
I'm hoping that one day you
and me make a movie together.
Hey. All right. Real
- Talk. All right.
- I think that the world should
- See that we can play.
It'll be a, a buddy cop
movie, the two Mandela's. Fre.
I said Fre. He also said
Fre. What he means is fries.
- He's saying fries, but it's fries.
That's a terrible, I think France.
- 'cause Mandela never said fries. Oh man.
I can see the movie now. A
human Mandela's fighting crime.
We would lock you up,
but we believe in Fredom.
So you can go Idris
Alba, Trevor, Noah, Mandela, Mantu.
I think we could do it. I
think we could do it actually.
Mandela Mantu. I think we
should do it. We should.
I think we could writer. Yo man, thank you
so much for, for joining me.
Thanks for having me, man.
Always. Thanks. Anytime. Anytime.

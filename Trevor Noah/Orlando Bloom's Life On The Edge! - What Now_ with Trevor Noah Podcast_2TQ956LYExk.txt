- If there was a zombie apocalypse
and we had essentially
just tools on the ground,
I would hope to be near you.
I dunno if that would be No, no, no.
You, you, you, you're pretty nice with it.
I've seen you with almost every weapon.
You are pretty nice with it.
- Well, thank you. I
appreciate that. I'll take it.
I'm not sure. You could kill, you
- Could kill a few zombies.
- You know, it is called acting as
well. You know, this Michael lyrics
- Aspect.
No, no, no, no.
This is what now with Trevor Noah.
You know, one of the weirdest
things about doing an
introduction when somebody's
sitting next to you is
that you want to give an
introduction that's as honest
as possible, but also as effusive
as possible without making
it seem like you're doing it
to the, so just act like you're not here.
Right, right. While I speak about you,
- I'm not here.
- Yeah. I'm chatting
to Orlando Bloom today,
who is arguably one
of the most recognizable
faces in the world,
because he has been, I
mean, the lead in some
of the biggest movies that
have shaped our lives.
I was thinking about the other day,
and we're gonna be chatting
today on the podcast,
because today he's, he's,
he's embarking on a different
journey where it's a,
it's a different type of trilogy
as epic, I would say, as,
as Lord of the Rings and
parts of the Caribbean.
Only in this story, he could actually die.
He doesn't, spoiler alert,
he's here. This is the great news.
- Yeah. Yeah.
- He's
- Here. Came close though. Came close a
- Couple of times.
Yeah. Came close, but, but
spoiler alert, he's here.
So, Orlando Bloom, welcome to the podcast.
- Thanks for having me,
man. It's great to see you,
- By the way.
When did you, when did you cut the hair?
- I just finished working in
London on this, this movie.
And we cut it for that. So
- When you cut your hair for the project?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
This is probably why I'd
never get into acting.
- Well, you've got beautiful hair,
Sam. You like Samson, right?
- No. You've got beautiful
hair. You've got, I like,
I don't know if I would
like the idea of me having
to change my appearance
for somebody else's also,
because it might be shit,
- Which is sometimes as you get
like a little older, you go,
oh, that could work really well though.
You need to embrace
that shit. Look. Right.
- No, what I mean is like,
imagine, imagine making something
that's shit and I cut my hair
- For it.
Oh yeah. Right. Oh, I've
done so much of that.
I've done so much of that.
And you go and well
forget just looking shit.
It's like the time that you put in. Yeah.
Like, I attack everything,
like Yeah. 110%. I can tell.
I can tell I'm like
fully loaded, committed.
So if it doesn't work, it's
just a lot of egg on my face
and a really bad hairdo.
- What's the thing you
regret doing the most
to your body for a project?
- Oof. Well, I don't know the answer to
that quite yet, but the
thing that I just did,
that I did extreme for my Body,
was a movie I just produced
and Star called The Cut, which
it's, it's a boxing movie,
but kind of, it focuses,
the fight is not the fight,
the fight is the battle to
cut, lose the weight, man.
Cutting is, oh man, cutting is
- Losing the weight.
- It's terrible. Yeah.
It's, it's terrible.
And I'm, I'm a boxer
kind of having, I, I'm,
I'm a boxer coming outta retirement
to have a last moment of a title fight.
But what I had to do was
transform my body in a major way.
And so I'm about, I'm,
as I sit in front of you,
I'm about 180 5. It's
probably similar to you ish,
- Right? What, what is that? In kilograms.
- I don't use fake
numbers. I dunno, I dunno.
I don't work in kilograms,
- But, ah, do you work in stone?
- Yeah, I used to work in stone.
I still don't understand
that, but now I'm like, yeah,
I don't understand stone either.
- Like the English seem,
everything seems correct.
And then it's like, what
do you waste? Stone. Stone.
I know. 2024. And
- People are like, oh, don't
you feel like it was probably
'cause they just had a bag of stones.
- Yeah. But it feels
- Like that they'd be like,
back in the day, in medieval
times they had a bag of stones.
- But it's weird for that to be now
- Still literally this day.
Oh, there's a lot of things
that are quite unusual about,
- It's like, oh, the economy, the GDP
and you know, oh yeah,
the, the new Teslas.
Oh yeah. Electricity. Or how
many stones does he weigh?
- Yeah. How many stones?
So, but anyway, 185 pounds I dropped
to one fifty two, a hundred eighty five
- Pounds.
- 35 pounds.
- That's 30, 30 ish pounds. Okay.
I think I know what that is.
That's like 70 something.
80, 80 something gram grams
- Was,
- How long did that take you?
- I worked with a really great
nutritionist in Santa Monica.
He basically tethered me. He
sort of teared me down on food.
And so I started just stripping out carbs
and basically was running
mostly keto, if you've heard of
that, you know, that kind of fat thing.
And then I ended up just eating tuna
and cucumber was basically not worth it.
It, and
- Not worth
- It.
And then what I did to make the last step,
I actually had this hot Epsom salt bath,
which is a technique the boxers use.
I dropped 10 pounds in one night.
I had 25 pounds of Epsom
salt and a boiling hot bath
- Up to my neck.
Does what does it do exactly? I've heard
about this, but I don't
understand what it does.
- It's like osmosis of some sort.
I think it's like, 'cause I
had to basically drink two
liters of water afterwards.
I went to bed and I woke up
and I stepped on the stale,
and I'd been on the scale,
like looking at my weight obsessively.
Right. So the movie really is,
is about the complexities of,
you know, the masculine as it
looks at weight loss, weight
gain, all of those things.
But yeah, it was brutal.
- Okay. But, so, so here's a, this is,
this is maybe the perfect segue
to get into your new show on Peacock.
You, you, you've made this new show.
- Yeah.
- Well, maybe, maybe.
Why is the, the most
important question for me?
I mean, not a bad question. Yeah.
Like, like you, you already
make movies, right? Okay.
And you're living your life.
You're a dad, you're a husband.
You, how
and why does Orlando Bloom
decide to make a show
that isn't, it isn't like
a cute easy show, which is
what I thought was gonna be
when I first heard of it,
you know, they were like,
oh, this is gonna be,
you're gonna be skydiving
and you're gonna be,
you're gonna be, you know,
free diving and you're gonna be
climbing. I was like,
oh, this is adorable.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- I wanna see you do this.
Yeah. And then I watched it.
I was like, this is, this
is work. This is horrible.
- Yeah. Yeah. It was a lot.
I sort of came up with
this idea during COVID,
but it was, I was just feeling
all the fear, you know,
around me all the time.
You know, we were all, I think
that was a really challenging time
for the planet, for the world.
I mean, actually a probably a
wonderful time for the planet
because we, nobody was doing anything
but for the, for, for
us humans on the planet.
Yeah. It was a super challenging time.
I think we can all agree.
And I actually have had this
Buddhist practice since I'm 16,
and I thought what I'd like to do
is meet people like
elders, like wise people,
and people who live a long time,
because I think we're also afraid of dying
because of this COVID
disease and talk to them.
But the, but we didn't
really get any bites on that.
They were like, how about
we just throw you out
of a plane down to the
bottom of the ocean and,
and you know, you can
try climbing something.
And I was like, yeah,
that works with my, sort
of, that works.
That's the other thing that
I would sort of probably find
- Because you're, you are a,
you're an adventure junkie,
- You know?
I am, I am definitely,
I definitely enjoy the
thrills and the adrenaline
and the high octane moments in life.
And I think part of that
is probably down to being,
you know, I was diagnosed
dyslexic as a kid,
but I'm also wasn't
diagnosed a DD There's loads
of labels you can give people.
Yeah. But like, you know, I think like
that definitely played into who I am.
And often, you know, when you
are, like, when I was a kid,
when I was on stage, I was terrified as a,
as a child performing on stage.
It's where I learnt performers,
just at school theaters and stuff.
But I was never more focused.
I was never more present.
I was never more moment than when I was
absolutely shitting myself.
- You, you, like, you didn't have time.
I, I can relate to this as
somebody who has a DHD, your,
your brain doesn't have the luxury Right.
Of being distracted
because you have to cons
it's life or death. Right.
- Right.
- You know what I mean? There's no like
checking your texts. No, there's no,
- No.
- You know,
- Meandering or Yeah.
You're on game time. And if
you are not in the moment, did
- You, did you feel that as a child?
Like, were you, were you, were you
cognizant of that as a child?
Or is it something that you
now understand in hindsight?
- Do you know? I only really
in the last two years, started
to look at, and this is even
before the show, I kind of
realized that a DD was something
that was definitely part
of my life when I actually
had a conversation.
And I remember sitting down in an office
with somebody and they gave me a list.
And I was like, I started
going through the list
and it was just like, tick the boxes.
And I was like, and I
just stopped ticking.
And I just looked. And then I
flipped over and I just looked
and I went, okay, I
don't need to It was you.
Yeah. I was like, this is everything.
And then I was like, I don't
want to take a pharmaceutical.
I'm English. And I think
America has, you know, got a lot
of stuff that they do
with pharmaceuticals.
- You're not wrong,
I'll tell you that much.
- So I was like, I don't
want to take an anti,
like somebody's gonna
get me from You didn't
- Wanna take like a stimulant. I didn't
- Stimulant.
And I'd been raw dogging it
for so long that I was like,
listen, this is my character
guys, you know, love me or leave me.
But I think my partner was
like, okay, you know, like
that doesn't work for somebody who's got
OCD. Yeah. You know what I mean?
- Because, because what, what
are some of the things you do?
So you, you race motorbikes. I saw you,
- Right? Yeah. You
- Race around the track.
- Yeah. - Right. What, do
you have a bike right now?
- I have, I, I have more than one. I do.
- What do you, what's
your, what's your goat?
I saw, I saw, I saw the Ducati in the
- Yeah.
I, I, I'm not riding super fast.
I've gotten an AIA that's for a
track, which is Oh, those are
fun though. Yeah. It's fast. And
- Those are nice.
Yeah. I've, I've always loved
the way the, the engine,
like it's such a specific
vibration. Vibration. Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah. I mean that whole feeling.
I think that like motorcycles, you know,
I started riding motorcycles
when I was a kid.
I really, you know, I had a, I got my,
my license when I was 16.
I rode a vesper around town
and, you know, if it was a cool,
and, you know, then I
rode a little motor London
around which, which town is
Canterbury? Happily on the wall. I
- Feel like
- London.
That's the joke. London
is the lu would've been,
- Yeah.
Like London, uk,
everywhere in the UK is
the least Vesper town.
Yeah. I can think like, I ride
bicycles everywhere. Go in the
- World. Right.
- Just to get around. Love
that London. I'm terrified.
- Yes. Yes.
- I'm ter There's more.
I remember even seeing the stats once
and I was like, it's one of
the most dangerous places
to ride bicycles in.
Yes, it is. Because your, I'm
sure your drivers in the UK
they have like a, they're
almost angry at you
for being on a bicycle
and passing them in the traffic course.
Yeah. Do you know what I
mean? It's like a Yeah.
- It's like, yeah. Yeah. You
know, it's true. It's true.
You're getting ahead of us.
It's like a massive Yeah.
It's like, it's sort of a
race, which actually I've,
I think I've, I inherited a bit
of that in my driving style,
which is like, like aggressive.
And it's your racing through the streets.
I mean, I'm, people hate
being in the car with me.
They think I'm dangerous, but
I think I'm super focused.
But I am, it is like,
I'm racing everybody.
So it's like, I'm like, okay, I need
to just take a chill pill.
Because I think there's a lot
to learn from that as well.
Right. A bit of grace.
Yeah. Yeah. A bit of grace.
I'm considering more.
- I'm, I'm, I'm fascinated
by this. Did it.
For those who know nothing
about the show, you
essentially choose three.
I don't even know if
you'd call them sports.
'cause they, they're all extreme. Yeah.
I guess they're sports.
They're extreme sports.
Yeah, they're extreme sports.
I don't know, it just
feels death defying to me.
You know, because you
have, what do they call it?
Wingsuit flying, what do they
- Call? Yeah, wing suiting. Wing
- Suiting. Wing
- Suiting. Yeah.
- Yeah. You have wing, wing suiting
where you're basically
like a giant squirrel.
- Yeah.
- You jump out of a plane
and then you hope for the best.
- Yeah.
- And then you do,
it feels like that you do diving.
- But free diving,
- No free diving, no tanks, no nothing.
- Essentially.
- Like Yeah. You might,
might just die coming
back up to the surface.
- Feels like it. Yeah.
- And then you have rock climbing,
but like all of these kind of the
- Yeah.
- Talk me through this moment.
So you're a dad, right?
- Right. - You, you are
currently with someone. I am.
When you say to them, Hey,
you know what I'm gonna go do,
I'm gonna go learn how
to jump out of a plane
and I'm gonna do this in two weeks.
I'm gonna get my jumping license.
- Yeah.
- My skydiving license.
You know, the one that normally
takes months. Yeah. Yeah.
I'm gonna do that in, in a week.
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna get qualified.
- Yeah. - And then I'm gonna
start wingsuit ing. Yeah.
- Don't think anyone done before.
- Actually, no, I don't think, I don't,
- I've never, we're trying to find
- Out. I've never heard of anybody. Do
- Do you think I could get a,
do you think I get, somebody
said to me the today, maybe
you could go for like one
of those Guinness Booker records
for like the quickest to a, to a wing suit
- Suit.
You might, you might actually have it,
because how many jumps
did you do in one day?
For instance, there's
the, in the first episode,
we just see you go jump
for jump jump, jump.
Yeah. For jump. For jump. For jump.
How many do you think you did in one
- Day?
Like the first day was
at least five, I think.
And then, you know, I mean the, the time,
the accelerated timeframe.
I mean, the thing is, is that,
what's crazy about that is
that every increment, everything
that you change technically
with the gear where
there's A different shoe.
Like we started with one
shoe, it's a beginner shoe.
Then you change to another shoe,
which has a totally different
feeling under canopy.
Right. The canopy is the shoe.
All of these different
things come into play.
And you are like, and you and you are.
And my brain is moving, trying to keep up
with the things that I'm learning.
And it's a pretty straightforward
thing when you jump out
of a plane, one to release a shoot.
If that doesn't work,
two, you release the shoot
that didn't work and three,
you're like, I've forgotten what it is.
It's one, one to release the
shoot. It says two to release.
Exactly. It's one to release
the shoot. It's pretty
- Straightforward.
Trevor, you see one, two,
lemme tell you now, in the,
in the calm space that we, we
are recording a podcasting.
It's pretty simple and
I, I've forgotten it. And
- There were three moves.
- Is this why you need
to do it? You need to
- Be like one, one out
the back is the shoot.
- Okay.
- Two to release it if it,
that didn't work for whatever reason.
- And then three is on the other side.
- Yeah.
- Three to,
- To open the second shoot.
So you have two shoots when you
- Jump.
If, if the first shoot
doesn't open in, it's a,
it's like a one in a thousand chance.
- Yeah.
- That the shoot doesn't open.
- That's right.
- We are watching you jump.
- Yeah.
- On the seventh jump,
I think, if I remember correctly.
- Oh my God. I've given,
I'm, I'm getting p
tss thinking about it
- On the seventh jump.
Your shoot doesn't open.
- Yeah. - Or it like opens
and then it's like a weird,
- So it opened actually,
which is not as insane
as if it hadn't opened,
which would've been,
I'd have been thinking in, in, in seconds.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- So the protocol is one,
two doesn't work.
One, two, I'm going.
So I was like, right baby,
here we go. One, two.
And then I was like, one,
my, the other shoot fell away
and I was into free fall again.
And then two, and then I
felt the canopy came out.
And I was like, I was just like, oh,
- You, you don't even realize
how terrifying this is
until you see the look
on the face of the guy
who was driving by.
- Can you believe we got
- That? You land
by the side of the road.
Mm. And there's some good,
like, just some good Samaritan.
- Yeah.
- Who drives up and don't
- You love that
- You saw his face?
He, he was like, how are you alive?
'cause all he saw was
somebody falling out the sky,
parachute, not working,
parachute a snap and
- Then a, a parachute land in the field.
- Yeah. In that moment, did your,
did your life flash be like,
people always talk about what,
what happened in that moment to you?
Is it fear? Is it adrenaline?
Is it, is it practice? Is it, it's,
- It's, you know what's
really interesting actually,
Trevor is, I think what I
learned most is that these kind
of wild people who do
these wild things, they are
experts in this, this little area.
Yeah. Like, people have
asked me if I've done any
of these things subsequently.
And the truth is I haven't, not
because I haven't wanted to,
but because I think
it's a lifestyle choice.
These people are experts. They
are, they were the family.
They are the people that taught
me how to, how to navigate.
And it's protocol. It's like
everything you depend on is
like, it's like, it's like
there's a protocol you follow
that so long as you're
good with your, your,
your, your maker.
- Yeah.
- You know, otherwise,
- But you, but you know what I
found that's, that's actually
one of the things I found like
really fascinating about the
show is there's this paradox, you know,
when you think of extreme sports
- Yeah.
- You think of all the people
who are doing everything
to risk their lives.
- Yeah. - And the one thing
I noticed when watching your
show was these people have more discipline
- Yeah.
- Than we have when That's right.
Like, driving on the
highway. That's so true.
Like, you know, the same way you'll go,
oh, I'm gonna look at my phone.
That's right. Lemme check a few
texts. That's right. Or a hundred
- Percent
- Did I put my seatbelt?
No. The people who do extreme sports
are the most disciplined people.
- Yeah.
- Because they, they acknowledge the fact
that at any moment it can end and it
- Lands out.
- And then ironically
in life, we are running
around like people cross the street.
- Yeah. We crossed can running over. Yeah.
- We cross the street. We
don't even pay attention.
You know? Do, do you, do you think
that changed something
in you at any point?
Like, did it make you, even
if it lasted for a few weeks,
was there more, was there a part of you
that was a little more
meticulous now? Huge.
- Huge. I mean, it was, it was
huge for me in that respect
because it, it, like, I like
to think that when I, I'm,
I overly prepare partly
because of dyslexia or whatever else.
Yeah. When I, when I'm preparing
to go into a, into a movie
or a character of some sort.
But this was like, okay,
this is life stuff.
This is, these are,
these are tools for life.
Like, and confidence.
Like, it gave me a certain
sense of like, oh man,
I I I did that.
I can do this.
This isn't, and I think, wait,
even at this stage in your life
- Yeah.
Because I, I would assume that you feel
accomplished all the time.
- No,
- I mean, that could be not
- Really.
I mean, I feel like I think,
you know, so young to have had
so much great, good fortune
- And to
- Come out the gate,
but not really knowing, you
know, my ass from my elbow
and just like, I mean, that's not true.
I trained, I went to like,
I always do this to myself,
but somehow, yeah.
Yeah. I think, you know, I think it's,
I think it's only really
getting interesting
for me now in some ways in
this, I dunno how you are,
you are, you are, you are a
few years younger than me.
Right. You're like, we're, you're
like, I'm, I'm like four seven, so,
- Oh, I just turned 40,
- So there you go.
Right. So it's like, yeah. So it's,
- Yeah.
But my, but my journey was,
you know, as, as much as you,
you went to school and you,
and you studied, there's a strange curse.
I I I'll think about for people who
experienced the pinnacle
and I mean the absolute
pinnacle of success.
- Yeah.
- Like, think about it, you,
you come out of drama school.
It was what your, your, your last week?
Two days before I finished. Yeah,
- There you go.
That I heard. But I mean, yeah.
- Yeah. And then you
get Lord of the Rings,
- Right?
Yeah. I mean, I've been
auditioning for months, but Yeah.
- Yeah. But this is what,
but they give you crazy.
So they, no, they give you the
announcements. They go crazy.
Alright. Lord of the Rings. It is on.
Even at that point, people
knew that this was gonna be one
of the biggest films ever made
because it was based on one
of the biggest books ever.
It was, it was massive,
massive, massive, massive.
The cost, the, the
everything, the budgets.
But in a strange way,
it's almost like dreaming
of being a mountain climber
and then your first mountain is Everest.
Yeah. And then, you know, then you go on
to do Pirates of the Caribbean.
Right. Right. And it's
like, oh, your second
mountain is Kilimanjaro.
- Right.
- I I often wonder like
how you keep yourself motivated
- Yeah.
- Or even stimulated.
- Yeah.
- When those are your first peaks.
- Yeah.
- Like what, like how, what's that been
- Like in life?
It's been a real, it's been a, it's a,
it's been a lot about evolving, I think.
I think that there was a period
where I was just, it just never ended.
I was either on a, on a set
or I was doing publicity for a movie.
If you think that there were three rings.
So I was, for three
years I was releasing a
huge movie with Lord the Rings.
And there were like three
Hobbits, two of which I did.
And then there were like Troy
and King, all these giant, yeah.
I just jagonal you can imagine
epic style movies. Right.
I think I had just gotten kind of like,
I'd lost a, I love what I do
and I think I, I just love what I do.
Yeah. And I, I'd had all
of this amazing opportunity
and I think a little bit like
that kind of Tolkien quote
of it, like where, where Billbo
says he felt like a piece
of toast that was spread a little thin.
You know, I just had, I
just had, I just had lost,
I'd lost a sense of who
I was and where I was.
'cause it, it, with, with all of the,
those huge movies came all
of this attention That I,
that I didn't really know what to do with.
And it was, you know, there
was always people following me.
And, you know, I couldn't
go anywhere in the world.
And I like to be in the world.
I like to go to places, you
know, it's like, I like to be
amongst people and I like
to ask pe I'm curious about people.
- Yeah.
- So I was suddenly like, you know,
not able to do those things.
That's why I picked up
motorcycling again actually.
'cause I could actually get to one place
without being followed the
helmet. Right. You know, the helmet.
- Can I tell you, I one
of my favorite things
when, when riding Yeah.
My friends used to ask
me this. They'd go like,
why do you like riding so much?
You know, when I used to
ride back in the day Mm.
And I said, one of my favorite
things about riding a motorbike
- Mm.
- Is you don't exist. Mm.
It's just the helmets.
- Mm. - And I found it was
one of the few instances
where there literally was no race.
There was no gender, there
was no where you from.
There were, and all
motorcyclists, we have like a,
a comradery about us.
Yeah. I agree. We all
know what's happening.
- Life at our heads. Yeah.
Every time we get on the
- Bike, it's this, it's this
interesting connection that you have.
But, but that anonymity
is also a special thing.
- Yeah. And I, I, I had,
you know, a child with my,
my ex now and, and I was
very present for him.
And then when we separated, I
was sort of, I was living kind
of like, you know, and not,
and not really working.
And, and then I sort of went on a bit
of a journey at that time.
And I was, I did a lot of
stuff with LED Hamilton.
I was living in Malibu and I did this
crazy swim training with him.
And then I was sort of
like flying on motorcycles,
on tracks, learning a few kind of,
I was doing a lot of adrenaline things.
I was really pushing my
edges, like trying to, I like,
- Do you think we, do
you think you were trying
to feel, what do you, what
do you think? I think I
- Was trying feel because I was numb
and I was probably depressed
and didn't really know
that I was depressed
because I had everything.
I, I'd chained everything
and everyone looked at
me like I had everything.
And I was like, you know,
but then it felt like, you know,
I remember Alec Baldwin
telling me on this,
on this movie set when we
worked on Elizabethtown.
He said, they'll give you the keys
to the executive bathroom.
Take the keys. I was
like, what does that mean?
He was like, if you don't,
there's a key right behind you.
I was like, okay, bro,
- What does that
- Mean?
It means you, you can
go into like the studio
and you can go into the executive
bathroom instead of going
where everyone else goes to the bathroom.
You know? Right. That's a
big deal. Anyway. I dunno.
But I think the analogy is,
if you don't take the key,
if you don't keep taking
that, making the most of
that moment, there will be a bunch
of guys, are you ready to go?
And they're gonna take that. Yeah.
- But, but can I tell, can I tell you?
- Yeah. I, - I'm, that's, I'm,
so, I'm torn on this idea.
I I agree. I'm torn on this idea.
I, I feel like one
of the worst things we've
done in the world today,
and you know, I, part of it
is a byproduct of capitalism.
Part of it is like the competitive
nature of like, you know,
it, it, it exists more in America,
but it's not like an, it's not a quote
unquote bad America thing.
It just, it happens in many places.
I think we threaten people
who dare to take a break
or try to find balance in
their lives by telling them
that if they do, there's other
people who are gonna take
what they're taking for granted when
they're not taking it for
granted. Do, do, you
know, do you know what
- I'm saying?
Yeah. That happens. But in this instance,
I think even like an energy wise,
like I think I had personally shut down.
- Oh,
- Energetically I had closed shop.
I was like, I was just
like, I am toast right now.
And I energetically didn't
know which way to boot.
- That's a scary place to be.
- And it created in me, I
think a very deep sense of,
you know, like, what,
what was my next, all
of these things that
had been so mapped out.
- Yeah. - And I didn't have
the work life balance. Right.
So, you know, that was
part of the problem.
And I always think I was
working, you know, that old
that age, are you working to live
or living to work kind
of thing. And, you know.
- Yeah, definitely.
- So at the time of doing the show
as well, it's like, how
do I just, how do I grow?
How do I, I'm I'm all
about evolving. Yeah.
Trying to grow, trying to be,
you know, I've, as you said,
I had a pretty unique experience.
So how do I stay kind creatively involved?
I mean, I basically now
for the last few years I've done movies
that probably there's considering what,
how many people saw the
first half of my career?
Virtually nobody's seen the
second half. Right, right.
As you know, the second chapter,
- It's a comp, it's really,
- It's like, it's artisanal.
It's, it's like, it's like,
but you know what I think I was missing
before I got cast in Lord of the Rings,
my agent in London had called me
and said, the RS C's interested
in you coming to work,
you know, coming to be in
rep and work with the RSC.
And I was like, Hey baby,
I've landed this is it.
Because in England it was
like, you go to theater.
- Yes.
- Maybe you get a bit of telly.
Yes. And then you go and do a movie.
- Right.
- And I was like, well, let's go.
What are we waiting for?
Let's go. I'm ready.
You know, pull me, let's go.
You know, but she, she never,
she never let on a thing,
by the way, about, you know, the,
about what was happening with rings.
And I was like, probably a DD
still just going out on all
these auditions, which
I get pulled out for.
I think I auditioned on tape
for Baz Lerman like five
or six times for Moulin Rouge.
And I, I kind of just did all of these.
And I would go up for
all sorts of auditions.
And it was like, that's a
skill as well. That's a muscle.
Right. To learn how to be
in a room and audition.
- Yes. Yeah. - So I was like,
not thinking about anything.
And then she gave me that call about Ring.
So I was like, wait, what?
But I often think, I wonder
what my life would've been like,
because in a way I missed this
part of my career, you know?
So I went back and did Romeo
and Juliet on Broadway.
I went back and did a
play on the West End.
I went back twice a couple of times.
I feel like in a way this, the, the things
that I've been doing in the
last few years, you know,
I did this crazy movie called,
they renamed it Retaliation.
It was originally Romans. I got
these, it dropped during COVID.
I got these crazy reviews. I got some
of the best reviews in my career actually.
It was wild. It was like,
it's, it's beautiful.
Nobody did that fill something.
Literally the thing, I think
one of the reporters just
to say said, yeah, Orlando Bloom
must be really gutted right
now because he's just
done some of his best work
and nobody's gonna see this movie.
Oh man. It was like, I was like,
- I was like, great.
Do you think, do you think
it filled something in you
that you didn't know you
needed filled because
- Filling?
I think I'm filling. Yeah.
I think it's a tank where
it's like, look, I think,
you know, we are all
on this journey, right?
We're all in our own fields,
in our own respective fields.
We've all got goals that we maybe look to.
And when you've, when you've had
so many met at such a young age,
then you're like, I need to,
- I kind of was going back to basics.
I was like, okay, what, how am I gonna,
I need to kind of do this.
I, I I skipped a step. Yeah.
- You know what I mean? Yeah. I skipped
the, skipped the theater.
I skipped the small
independent movies. Yes.
But I, there was something
I felt was missing.
So I've sort of been building that part
of my life and career.
Yeah. Because I think I, you
know, hopefully I'll have,
you know, it'll, it'll, it'll only kind
of keep getting better is my hope.
You know what I mean? And I
wanna, I wanna fill the gaps in
the foundation that I felt
were mi were maybe missing.
And even if that's true or not.
So that's kind of what I've been doing.
And it's been, there's
been a few roll of the dice
and some of them have
worked, some of them haven't.
But, you know, I love,
every time I stand on a set,
I always think like,
where would I rather be?
And unless it's with family and my kids
or something, even I'm just like,
it's just, I'm in my happy place.
There.
- We're gonna, this conversation right
after this short break,
one of the more interesting
parts of the, of the show
is learning that you essentially,
did you break your back?
Or did you, what did you do to it?
- Yeah, I, I fell three
floors and I, I crushed T 12.
- I need to understand what happened
because you obviously, you allude to it.
And then we see the pictures
of you in the hospital and
- We,
- And essentially there's a moment
where doctors said, Hey,
you're never gonna walk again.
- Yeah.
- So explain to me what happened.
Where were you, how do
you fall three floors?
Because they just say that in
passing, he fell three floors.
And I was like, how, where
do you fall? Three floors?
I've, I don't know how that's possible.
- So I was in my second
year at drama school,
I just finished a, like,
we'd had this five aside soccer match
with the other drama schools.
We'd gone to a pub. I hadn't
- Did you wait, did you win
or lose any, the details?
Anytime there's, there's a
football match. I need to know the,
- I can't imagine that we won.
We weren't, we weren't the winning side.
- Okay.
- In memory. Okay. Got it. Got it.
I probably blanked that out.
I'd gone to a pub with
everyone afterwards.
Had a Sunday roast of maybe one pint.
Not like I was a big drinker.
I've never been a big drinker.
And then I went over to these,
these friend's house in,
in Chepstow villages in,
in, in, in Notting Hill.
And I, they'd just moved in these,
these two girlfriends of mine.
And they, they, they'd had
this fourth floor apartment
and the, the stairwell that went up
to the flat had a landing
below their fourth floor apartment.
And the door, they said,
oh, we, we can't get
that door open, but there's
a roof terrace for us to use
and we're gonna put plants and stuff.
And I was like, oh, it just needs
to be kicked in from the outside.
So anyway, I was like,
you'll have to get that.
Anyway, we walked into the apartment.
I was like, wow, this is
such a great apartment.
I looked at the window. This is the a
DD impulsiveness, right?
Yeah. This is, this is a
hundred percent what that
- Is. I'm seeing it now.
- I looked out the window,
I was like, oh, wow.
I looked to the surface. I said, oh wow.
There's the roof terra.
And I kid you, the,
the roof terra is probably
from this chair to where,
you know, a meter and a half to the left.
And I'm like, oh, I could
just jump. I could jump that.
That's no problem. But then
instead I saw this piece
of metal running down the wall,
which was not a drainpipe
that you could hold onto.
It was a piece of metal,
like coming out the wall
like, like this.
And I was like, oh, well if
I just pinch it like this,
I'll grab hold of it like this.
- You've watched movies clearly,
- And I'll kill
- Me across. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Right. Somehow I was like, I'll pulled
it and just pull across.
And I got outta the window
held onto this thing.
And of course there's nothing
for my feet. And I just fell.
And I landed on a, from a
floor floor window on a first
floor balcony that had, you know,
in England they have those, Jesus.
So this, the railings are going around
with those like, you
know, spears. Oh. With
- Like the spikes.
- The spearhead and the, and
the, an old washing machine.
And I landed like plumb
between the middle of it.
And I was like, I think out
for a couple of minutes,
my best friend who's actually in the show.
- Yeah, yeah,
- Yeah. He was like, Gibo gibo.
I was like, and I was out.
And then I kind of remember coming around
and I was like, I think
my first thought was,
who's gonna play Cino in 12th night?
'cause I was having a really
good time playing Aino.
I was like, I'm not gonna be doing that.
And I was like, I can wiggle
my toes, but nothing else.
And I was obviously in shock
and your body, I think when you, you know,
the pain came later.
But, but, but essentially London
is amazing by the, this is,
this is why I'll pay taxes for the rest
of my life wherever I, but I'm
like in London specifically.
'cause like there was nobody
in that first floor flat. Yeah.
That I was on the balcony they got.
So they ended up getting a
fireman, winching him in,
he kicked open the doors
to this somebody's house
destroying their doors.
No doubt. They opened and
got the special services in.
So they called this the Royal
Stem Orthopedic Hospital.
And they said they'd
just got a hospital flu.
So they were tanking. No more inpatients.
They was like, no more.
But they were like,
we have a 20-year-old kid may never walk
again unless you take him.
And they were like, so
they took me at walking
pace in an ambulance.
My parents were in the car,
a car behind following, like
with police escorts.
Took five hours to get from
Paddington to North London
to this other hospital so that
I would be able to be seen
and treated at this, you know,
much better hospital where
that that could handle what I, my case.
And so when I got in, it was like, yeah,
for four days they were
like, yeah, yeah, that's,
- Yeah.
Were, were you, were you
present when they were
saying, were they saying this to you?
- Yeah, I was. I was, I was very present.
I was in a lot of pain.
I basically had almost
severed my ni spinal cord,
but I hadn't quite, so I, like,
I remember this sensation,
they had a cage over my legs.
'cause if I touched my legs,
it was like razor blades
coming up under the skin
or like electricity.
It was crazy. The nerves had gone.
There was this wonderful
nerves actually who she used
to come in at night and
move my legs, move my body.
'cause she was like, I don't
even know where she came from.
These are, this is the, the,
the NHS care stuff, you know, amazing.
Amazing. But so I'm in this hospital,
I'm looking at the bed of opposite me.
And there's a, there's a guy with a cage.
One of these, they call
it a halo, it's a cage.
Young 18-year-old guy jumped into a lake.
He used to be in the army.
His parents were just weeping by his bed
'cause he was never gonna walk again.
And there was a guy to
my left who'd fallen off
a ladder and broken his back.
And he was wearing this plastic cast.
And he turned to us and he
looked and we were chatting
and I was just getting used to
looking at like the ceilings
and thinking, oh, I could get used
to looking at ceilings, I suppose.
I mean, you know, they're
kind of interesting.
It's a different perspective. Right.
He said he knocked on his chest
and he goes, if you get one of these
mate, you're gonna be good.
And I was like, what? He
goes, this, this, this.
So the surgeon came
first, they were like, you're not walking.
And they said, we're gonna do an M mri
'cause you, you're physically able
to move you to, to the MR mri.
And they were like hanging on by a thread.
So we're gonna try opening your spine.
We will pin and plate above
this one crushed vertebrae.
And the two below that are fractured.
But we will put a structure
around it, a titanium structure
so that you can move and,
and then we'll see what happens.
And basically I got this,
finally got this plastic cast.
And, and I, you know, I mean, I was 20,
so admittedly youth was on my side and
- Yeah.
But still youth and then, you know,
- Yeah.
- As you said, your, your
maker slash your slash your
ancestors slash whatever
you want to, whatever you
- Wanna call it, and
your, whatever you wanna
call it, came in heart
- That that clearly changes
how you see the world
and it changes how you see life.
- Yeah. - When you are now
climbing it, it was interesting
of, of all the, of all the
sports you were participating in.
The first time you looked
uncomfortable to me
was when you had to climb.
So jumping out of an airplane,
you were like, all
right, tell me the rules.
How does this go? Right?
There's even a point
where you come in really hot, one
of your parachute landings,
I thought you were gonna break your legs
and you were just like, ha
ha, did you guys see that?
Did I scare you? Ha ha.
And you just carry on. Yeah. You really
- Just carry on
- The first time
where it just felt like a little bit
of your swag disappeared.
- Yeah.
- Was when you had to climb.
- Yeah.
- Yeah. There there's two things I wanted
to know about that is like, one,
what did you learn about
getting over your fears
or your traumas in that
experience and in that moment?
And did you, and then the
second one is, how did you,
how did you put that much trust in people
who you'd never really met Yeah.
Never spent any time with Right.
But fundamentally had to believe Yeah.
Had your best interest at heart.
- Yeah. Overcoming the fear was,
was a sort of, I've had this sort
of unique trust in life
since I'm very young.
And it's not really any
rhyme or reason for it,
but I just mentally went to
that place, which I
think you do when you're
in, when it's game time.
When you're like, this is it.
I'm on the most challenging thing.
The fearful thing about that,
by the way, was, was for me,
was with parts of my
dyslexia and other things.
It was like these knots,
- Learning to tie the knots,
- Knots and these,
and when you're gonna move
these things, it's just
- Like the loop goes that
way. And if you go the other
- Way, then it's wrong.
And then, and it's like,
and if you go wrong way, so
that was like, I just had
to commit to the process
and be as present to it as possible
and trust that this was
something that was meant for me
and that I'm on this journey
and I'm committing to it.
So I'm gonna go like I do 110%, you know,
and I'm gonna go into it.
And the really hard
part was the second part
to your question, which was trusting
and meeting mo for the first time,
and who was an adaptive climber
who has climbed since She's a child
with one hand, born with one hand.
So her spirit and her confidence
and the twinkle in her eyes was really
kind of leading me forward.
And I was like, look, if she can do this,
and she's telling me I can
do this, I can do this.
But I was, I, I had terrible
potty mouth on that shot.
They beeped me about a million times
because I was so, I was, there were points
where pop muscles in my back
and in my body that I
didn't even hadn't know
- Existed.
Yeah. Existed. Everyone
says, when you climb,
- You - Learn parts of your
body you never knew you had.
- And you know, I knew I fell,
I was gonna fall on a rope.
So in some ways it
didn't have the same abs
abject terror, right, okay.
Of standing on the edge of something.
But the climbing was just, it was
so challenging
to overcome.
At one point, I'm climbing
this in this video bit,
and I completely, I've had,
I chant since I'm a kid.
And this woman goes, so what
do you do? I go, I breathe.
And she goes, well, 'cause
my head was so spinning,
it was like, I ch and I'm like,
and then suddenly I was
like, okay, I'm doing it.
I can do it. You know what I
mean? It's like my magic kind
- Of Yeah.
- Tape, if you like. And so I'm like,
just like chanting my way through,
which is like basically just saying,
I'm grateful, I'm grateful,
I'm grateful. I've got
- This, I've got this. You
- Know,
- I don't know if my read was correct,
but when I was watching the show, I felt,
I felt like I learned a lot
more about you as a person.
You reveal parts of yourself
that are forcefully drawn out
by the, the severity of the situation.
- Right.
- You know, so, so when, when, when you,
when you are wing suiting
and you're, you're skydiving
and you're getting, you know,
accredited in, in the space
of a weak I see, I see a side
of you that is like, you, you,
you really push yourself.
I couldn't help but wonder
where you get that from.
You, you have like, such a is like,
are you hard on yourself? Yeah. Are
- You Yeah, probably.
You know, I I I don't want to,
I don't want to, I don't want
to ever look back and think
I didn't suck the marrow.
Right. Because I feel like,
I feel like there's, there's,
there's like, I would
always take the, the,
the harder path, right.
Because I would get something
from that, you know?
And I think that that's what
the show represented for me,
taking the hardest path possible
to confront this fear at a time
where I'd felt so much fear.
And it's just that, like for
me, I'm, I'm super privileged,
you know, I'm super blessed.
I've had this insane life.
What is it gonna take for
me to be out of that to it?
It, it took this insanity, huh.
Hopefully the takeaway
is let's step outside
of whatever it is, is our comfort zone
- Mm.
- So that we can, and,
and, and trust and engage
and be curious and learn
and sort of try to, that
was, you know, that's
what I'm, that's me.
Right. Trying to do that stuff.
That's just, you know, and,
and I think the hardness is like,
it's, it's probably just
an, an ancestral thing.
And like, you know, I think partly having
so many remarkable experiences so early
- Yeah.
- Like I, my whole life
played out on giant movies
that everyone watches Yeah.
Had watched. And I was just
still learning, you know,
like I look at some of my peers
and you know, like some of my friends
who were in the business
who started in the
Disney Club, you know what I
- Mean? Yeah.
- So like acting was like
second nature to them.
They're like all directors now
or like wanting, you know, they're like,
literally they started at 12
and they're in the, so
they, they have timing,
they have comedy, they have
dance, they have everything
that they, I was like, I was
doing school plays, you know,
playing the Pirates of Pennants
and the police officer.
I didn't even play the pirate.
I played the fuck, you know,
I played the character,
you know, and I was like, you know, I went
to the National Youth Theater and I
didn't get the lead roles.
I was like the spear carrier.
And by the way, chewy Chew,
I'm not, shouldn't Chew Tell
who was like, he played Othello, right.
And he was like, I was like on stage
with him when he was
doing it, and he was like
chewing and he's phenomenal.
The scenery. Oh my God.
- Yes.
- He's just like chewing the scenery.
We were all looked up to him
and he was just like crushing it as a,
I've never seen an animal
on stage like it as a kid
where he is just dominating.
And I'm like, so I'm like with my spear.
And, and the guy was like, just
pipe down with the spear lander.
You're not like, do you know what I mean?
I'm like, you know, it was like that.
So I'm learning everything,
but like in these tiny bits of moments.
So then I'm suddenly 18,
no 20, and I'm going off
and I'm, I mean, it was
the most amazing education.
And thankfully Peter Jackson
and, and Fran, his partner
and that whole team in New
Zealand were just like,
and Ian McKellan, Ian Hol,
you know, Christopher Lee?
Vigo Mortenson was my, was
my mentor basically. Yeah.
He didn't even know it.
I used to sit next to him
and just like absorb his,
and that guy, there's a guy
who's committed, there's a guy
who knows, like there's
a guy who's an artist.
Yeah. I think I felt
like maybe it was like,
people would like to
say, and people probably
think or said it was a layup.
They don't know the work
that went into it before.
- Yeah. Okay. So in
- A way
- Okay. So
- In a way it's like they
don't know the amount
of auditions I went through.
This makes a lot of
sense. Or the fact that I
left home at Yes.
You know, I left home at 16
to move to London on my own.
Yes. To hustle like a crazy person. Yeah.
To get into drama school,
fail the first time,
second time get in Right.
Then to get myself through drama school
to work on the weekends, folding
clothes to sell, you know,
to get I, you know what I mean? It's like,
- There's a, there's a beautiful phrase.
I, a friend said it to
me once, she said an,
she was actually on the
podcast a a few episodes ago
for my birthday, but she was
saying she, I love this line.
She said, she said overnight
success does happen overnight,
but the preparation leading up to
that point takes a lifetime.
- Yeah.
- And I think
that's sort of what you're speaking to is
- I, I, I was, I was, because
- It's zero to everything.
- I was, I was, but not for
you. Probably eight or six.
And I used to sit in the school gym
and imagine that I was Superman flying in
to get my girlfriend or something.
It was like, I had like fantasies
of playing like the full guy.
Right? Yeah. Like Lee
Majors. I used to watch that.
Or you know, like, it was
things like Dallas and LA Law.
I was very like, you know, watching TV
of American, the American style.
Yeah. You know what I mean?
Like, it was all of that
that led to the, and I think
breaking my back, you know,
I think if anything, I remember
going back to drama school
and I sat in this circle of friends
and it was all like, everybody had
to speak about what they were gonna do.
And we all had to speak about
what the other, what we,
how we saw the other person.
Right. So everybody
said like, what are the,
when we come outta drama school,
you know, we talked about,
and everybody went around
and we were like, oh, this is
what Maya does.
She's this amazing Italian actress
- Yeah.
- Who I, I love and adore still.
And, and, and you're sort of
imbuing all of these people
with like, you are dead dreams.
- It was beautiful.
- I like this. It was really special.
And people said wonderful things,
even though I'd broken my back.
And they were like, and, and people
who I didn't even think like me, honestly.
And they were saying these
wonderful things about, about
what they thought I
could, I was capable of.
And it was as if I didn't know that.
It's a very weird thing. You, you,
you mentioned this
earlier, I think there's,
there is a disconnect,
which is probably why I
keep going back to
- Like, yeah, no, this makes sense
- To building it out.
You know what I mean? This
makes lot of sense. And I'm with
that lot.
It's like, I work, I just work.
You know, it's like, just keep showing up.
I think Tom Hanks said that, right?
It's like, and something will give
and it's like, in a weird
way, I like that though.
- So the other thing I learned was you,
one of the parts of the show
that's, I mean, in, in Time,
it probably takes no time in the show,
but it has I think some of
the most gravitas in the show.
It's, it's the moments where
you're talking to Katie.
- Yeah. Yeah.
- And it, it's, it's beautiful
because it showed me
something about the two of you
that is very difficult
for people to understand
until you see it.
- Yeah. - And it's that you
seem to be pursuing a life
of purpose.
A a life of, of peace.
And also, strangely enough,
like a li a life of normalcy.
- Yeah. - Which is strange
because like Katy Perry, one
of the biggest pop stars that's
ever lived, Orlando Bloom,
one of the biggest actors
that's ever been, you know,
like the movies, not
really the blockbuster,
you name it Trilogy after trilogy.
Right, right. But it's,
there's this strange thing
where it seems like the two
of you have found a connection
that exists in peace and normalcy.
Like, and I, I could be wrong.
You could just be like,
Nope. No, you, you're
- Right.
I, I think one of the things
that I fell in love with
with Katie was like, I didn't really,
she hates when I say this, so
I have to word it carefully,
but her music was everywhere.
Right When I came up, it was
just on every radio station.
But I wasn't conscious of like, I wasn't
what I was listening to,
but like, I fell in love
with this, with Catherine,
this girl from Santa Barbara, you know,
and by the way, parents,
pastors living on food stamps.
- Yeah.
- We're not talking glamorous.
- Right.
- Montecito like, or Santa
- Santa Barbara.
It's the side of Santa
Barbara. No one knows.
- Yeah. It's the side that no one knows.
And we both understand.
I think we both meet each
other with understanding
where we came from, what, what
we worked to do, what we had
to do to get to where we got to.
And she definitely
demands that I evolve.
Right. And I feel I do the same for her.
And that makes for
fireworks, pardon the pun.
But it also makes for a lot
of fun and a lot of growth.
And, you know, I wouldn't
change it for anything.
Even when sometimes it feels
like, how do we do this
because we've got these two
giant careers and lives and,
and hers is even, you know, there's even,
it's like a universe sometimes.
Yeah. Yeah. But I think I
just keep coming back to her
and trying to like, hold her hand
and walk it back to the
sand pit and be like, yeah,
but this is, we're just
gonna build a sandcastle.
You know? And she loves to do that too.
She's like, she's like,
oh yeah, the sandcastle
or the ride of the bike.
You know, the, the little,
the little moments that, that,
that, and she's a master
at helping to, you know,
do create the help, help
to keep building those moments, you know?
So I try to, I try to
hold a space big enough.
I try to be big enough.
I think even, you could
even say in the show,
it was like me proving to
myself that I was man enough,
big enough, whatever, capable enough.
'cause part of it was I
learned to be capable in that
- Show. Hmm.
- In life in a way that like,
and it's like, see, I could do it.
- Yeah
- Mom, I can do it.
- Yeah.
- See this babe. I can do it.
You know, if you thought I
couldn't, I drive too fast.
Look at this. You know
what I mean? But in a way,
you know, that's me.
That's my journey. Yeah.
That's my journey of evolution.
To like constantly remind
myself that, you know,
of the things that, you know,
'cause I, sometimes I
forget. I mean, maybe,
- But it, but it seems like
she never forgets that.
That's what I mean, is so powerful. Yeah.
And I hope, I hope people watch
the show, even if it's just
for that moment, in that reason.
- Yeah. - Every time you
do something amazing in the
show, and it's amazing.
Not just because you've
done it, but because
of the timeframe that you've done it in.
You seem to be surprised
and you seem grateful and you seem happy.
She seems like it was a confirmation
of something she always believed about
you. Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah.
- This was a moment where,
and she either says it or she intimates.
She almost has a vibe of like,
all right, now come home.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You jumped, you did it.
I knew you were gonna
do it. Now come, don't.
- Right. - You know what I
mean? Yeah. Yeah. And, and
it, it, it really is.
It really is stunning. Don't go anywhere.
'cause we got more What now after this?
I, I could talk to you
forever about this. I love it.
But you know, unfortunately, time is time.
- Yeah, that's right.
- Some people say it doesn't exist.
- Are you gonna come jump with me then,
- Trevor, jump away.
- We'll jump out of a plane
together. Let's do that.
I'll get you with Luke. You'll love it.
Confront some of those fears.
Have you done it before?
Maybe you've done it before in
- My life. I haven't done it before.
- Let's do it. Let's
go jump out of a plane.
- So here's the thing. Here's the thing.
Orlando, I, I come from an African family
and there's one thing I've promised myself
and my family that they
won't, all they'll need to do,
if they ever, God forbid,
have to come to my funeral,
all they'll have to do is cry.
Okay. They won't have to ask questions.
They won't have to justify why
I'm there or how I'm there.
They will just, they'll just
get to cry and go, Trevor's.
Now, God willing, none of
them will ever be coming
to my funeral 'cause
they're older than me.
What would be your fear then?
- What would be, what would
be the one that you would do?
- No, no. All of them are my Are they?
But, but it's not like my,
what I mean by it's not,
my fear is I don't, I don't have a fear
of jumping out of a plane.
- Right.
- I just think
- Even don't have a desire either.
- Yeah, exactly. So I,
I think of it this way.
I think in life, you don't
have to prove anything.
We have a limited amount of luck,
and we have a limited amount of,
- I don't believe that
- This, this magical life
force thing, I think I got that's,
- That's my brain now.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah. It's endless.
- This is what happens if you break your
back and then you walk.
I mean, after that you go like,
I can probably do it again.
Please. You know? No, and then it's great.
It's great for you.
But yeah, I don't know.
I, I, look, I'm not saying
I won't ever do it. Right.
You know, I, I bungee jumped and,
- Oh yeah.
Well, there you go. Now that's, I've done.
That's, that's an intense feeling. You so
- It's safer than skydiving,
but it is more terrifying.
- Yes, it is.
- It is. It's terrifying.
It is terrifying.
And I, I never want to do it again.
I don't need to do it again.
People, I love it. I hated it.
I hated all, I hated jumping.
I hated waiting to jump.
Did jump. I hated falling
in South Africa. Yeah. Yeah.
That's crazy. At the time.
Crazy. It was the highest jump.
Yeah. That one. Yeah. It's
ter it's just terrifying.
Terrifying. Yeah. And then
there's a moment where you
just hang upside down.
You just, this is all that's
happening. Blood rush. You dangling
- The
- Blood's rushing to your head
- And you think, why did I do this?
- And then it feels like
your feet are slipping out.
And so, and then you get to
the top and they're like, huh.
Huh. How's that? You're
like, I'm like, no,
- I'm good. Thanks.
- It felt like I jumped off a bridge.
Do you know what I mean?
Yeah. There was nothing
that changed in me off.
Like I, 'cause lemme put it this way.
I, I believe as Trevor,
I can jump off a bridge if I need to.
I believe this. So nothing
changed after that.
I didn't walk away from it going,
you see, I can jump off a bridge.
I knew I could. If I need to,
I will jump off of a bridge.
- Right. - But I'm, I'm
not, I hope I don't need to.
- Right - Before I let you
go, I'll ask you the question.
Ask everyone who comes on on the podcast,
and thank you again for joining me.
You know, I having me your
time, the conversation.
I love it. You being candid,
- Love what you're doing here.
- What now? Like, what, what does,
what does Orlando seek to do now?
Because again, you, you have sort of
done the same thing that you did
with Lord of the Rings and Pirate.
This is another trilogy, but
this is a personal trilogy.
- Right, right,
- Right. Where do you wanna
see yourself? I think from,
- Here's like three visions.
If I can make good on this
promise that I made to myself,
that, that for my career, right?
- Yeah. - Like, if I can
make good on this promise,
then I'll be able to use
what I've been doing there
to, to support my work.
Like which unicef, which
I've done for like 20 years,
which I find like to be the
most rewarding thing in my life
outside of my family.
- Right.
- So if I keep moving those three around,
so it's just, it's a quite
- Family,
- Family.
Not in any specific order. Family, family.
It's like if I, if I, my
career's going right, if I'm,
if I keep just showing
up for my career, okay.
And it keeps working, then it
gives me a, a greater platform
to keep working on unicef,
which is really something
that I think they do amazing work.
And then, you know,
and then my family will be taken care
of. And that's the most important thing
- To me.
Interesting. And so it's
a trifecta that keeps
- It's trifecta that just keeps working.
Yeah. It's like, okay,
keep doing this, do this.
I'm with you. You know,
and then, then you're good.
Do you know what I mean?
Yeah. And, and you know,
I think simplify Honestly.
Like I'm, you know, I think I'm,
I'm seven years more older than you,
and I think it's like I've got, oh fuck.
So I just need to like, who wants to sift
through this stuff when I'm gone?
You know what I mean? Like, get rid of it.
You know what I mean? Like,
I'm like, but it's so valuable.
Is it? Does anyone really know?
But you know, just think the,
the over my attachment to things.
Right. And just like, just
simplify so that you can just,
the one thing my mom did say to me is he
who travels light travels far.
I dunno where I missed that
lesson. 'cause I keep saying it.
And I did not, I do not travel light,
but I like to think I travel
far and, and mostly in my head.
So I'm just, you know,
slowly preparing for death.
- Damn. I mean, that is,
that is both, you know, I,
I recently meditated with some monks.
Yeah. And it's funny because,
you know, you, you practice
- Buddhism. Yeah.
- That is one of the
fundamental principles
- Yeah.
- Is understanding that
it is all fleeting.
- Yeah.
- Understanding that it is all temporary.
- Yeah.
- But having more appreciation
for it because of that.
- It's like, we keep, we, you know, some
of us just keep focused on this life.
It's like, like let's, I'm
thinking about the next life.
You know what I mean?
I'm like, not this life.
Lemme just don't fuck it up.
I've already been given some plate.
I've been dealt some pretty nice hand.
- Yeah.
- Don't f it up,
but like, let's build for the next one.
So when you drop in next time you've like,
you've done enough to be able
to go, okay, am I good here?
Do you want me back? You know what I mean?
Right, right, right. In a
way, you know what I mean?
Like, in my brain, I'm
like, did I, did I get
flying colors last time around
or I like that enough to bring me back.
You know what I mean? So that's, yeah.
- What, what seeds do you plant today
to enjoy the forest tomorrow, essentially.
- Correct. Yeah. Correct. And,
but even if a lifetimes, I
always say, I used to say
to Katie, you know, like,
we're doing lifetimes baby.
Like, you're here and
we're doing lifetimes.
It's not this one. So let's,
you know, it's like we're doing life.
I, I think everything is missed.
I think we're all
interconnected, you know? So.
- Yeah. Yeah. Well, thank
you. I like that. Thank you.
Thanks, man. Thank you for,
for this lifetime, for this moment.
And thank you for the next one.
- Yeah.
- I'm glad you're alive.
- Thanks, dude. Yeah. Appreciate you.
We'll do this again another time.
We will definitely love it.

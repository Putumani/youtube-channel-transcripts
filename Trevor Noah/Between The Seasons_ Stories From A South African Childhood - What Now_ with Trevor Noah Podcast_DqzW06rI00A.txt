- Before the new season
begins, we return to
where Trevor's story was
first written, South Africa
in the laughter and struggles
of childhood lie, the roots of
who he became.
These are the tales we gather. Now
our journey begins where
Trevor's family always began
with prayer in the townships.
Prayer was more than faith,
it was identity, a reminder of
where you belong.
- This is the awkward part. How, how you
start a conversation.
It's the worst part of
every conversation. It's
- The worst part.
Why don't we start with a prayer?
This, this is actually why our grandmother
started meetings with prayers.
Oh yeah. The cut. The awkward. Yeah.
Because it's to cut the
awkwardness. Because now you're
gonna, you can't just come together
and be like, your son has a drug problem
and your husband is cheating.
If you start with a prayer,
then it opens it up.
- But it was also a township power move
because everyone here will
know whose house this is.
Because you can't lead a prayer at,
- You can't lead a prayer
at somebody else's house.
No. When you pray, when you pray in a
South African household, right?
Mm. First of all, like, I don't,
I don't know if your grandmother did this.
My grandmother used to give her a dress
and she used to give like where she's
from and her name and everything.
No, my grandmother did
that. No, really? My
mom, my grandmother would do that.
Yeah. She'd be like, and
then she'd be like, location,
- Orlando.
- What location? Yeah. Who
you are, where you're from, whatever.
And I remember I asked her once, I
was like, why are you doing this?
And then she was like, why
do I assume where I am? Yeah.
She said, hi. She said,
Trevor, I I must just assume
that God is always listening to me.
She'll go, yeah, yeah,
yeah. That's not fair.
And if you think about
it, most South African,
like prayer in general,
I think is very like,
considerate of God.
It's very much like we know
that you're doing stuff
and we know that. Like,
you know what I mean?
- Yeah. But I need to, I think
because of missionaries, we never
as black people thought
that God is with us.
God was brought to us.
- Huh.
- So we always have to identify ourselves
and also separate ourselves
from the non-believers.
- It's funny now that you say
the missionary thing. Yeah.
I actually think a lot of that was real.
- Hmm.
- Is that like,
'cause think I, I always think about this.
I go like, imagine being a black
person anywhere on the continent.
Mm. Right. These people
come with religion. Right.
And then they tell you
that the reason things are
going bad in your life is
because you don't have religion.
This, this god in particular.
'cause there was religion.
Okay? There were different
religions all over the continent,
all over South America,
all over these places.
They would force, you know,
the, the native people
that they would force them
to buy goods from them
that nobody else wanted to
buy at predetermined prices.
They would say they would
do the work of like donkeys
and mules and, and all of that stuff.
But the main thing was they
also came in with religion.
So everywhere in the world, I
can see this, this, this vibe
where people have come in with
religion saying to you, Hey,
all these bad things that
are happening to you are
because you don't worship God.
And then it must have been weird
because the natives are like, you,
you are the bad thing
that's happening to us.
They're like, yes, exactly.
If you had prayed and you have penicillin,
- This wouldn't be happening to you.
I thought you didn't need
penicillin. 'cause you can pray.
Yay. Go put on clothes.
It's not cancer time. Yet.
- Trevor's mind moved to its
own rhythm. Some saw disorder.
Yet it was a gift, A gift
that once left him shoeless,
or on the side of the
road, on his way home.
- My record with my mom, the, the story
that she keeps bringing up is,
one day I came home from school,
I had no backpack and I had no shoes.
- Come on.
- And then my mom said to me,
and my cousin always
tells a story as well,
because he says, that day I got one
of the all time beating all time.
And he says, he remembers
like watching me going,
but this could have been avoided.
He was also a child. And he was
like, he says, he watched me.
And he, he thought to himself,
but he could have avoided this.
And what had happened was I came home
and apparently my mom was
like, where's all your stuff?
And I said to her, I
said, the bag got heavy.
- Put it down.
- So I put it down.
I literally left it on
the side of the road.
I put it down very logical to me. Logical.
- Yeah.
- And then she said, and
what happened to the shoes?
And I said, the shoes were new
and I didn't want to finish them.
So I left them somewhere
close to school so
that I don't have to wear
them out on the way home.
Because, you know, like your
shoes would get worn out
on the, on the sides.
Right. Like, we couldn't afford new shoes
the same way other kids could.
So I noticed kids always had
like a flat heel on their shoe.
- Look at how observant you are though.
- Yeah, exactly. And then
my shoes had the slant.
- That looked terrible.
So I was like, okay, if
I can preserve my shoes,
then I won't get laughed at as much.
So I'll leave the shoes near school
and then walk home barefoot.
And we went back and every
everything was where it was. Oh.
Which means my plan worked Technically.
- Technically,
- Yeah. But she, she couldn't understand.
And my brain, I remember
thinking this made sense.
And to me, to me it makes
complete sense. Yes.
- As children, Trevor
and his friends turned the
streets into playgrounds
claiming space where none was given.
He remembers how community
can be built from nothing
but bricks and courage.
- I think the truth is that we think,
we don't have the third
spaces, but we, it's, it's just
because we've made every
space a private space.
Like I was just thinking this, walking
around like parts of
Brooklyn the other day.
I've noticed a dip in how
many block parties there are.
- Yeah. Just that was a simple event
where you close the street.
- You agreed. Neighbor at the end.
Neighbor at the end. We all
agree on Saturdays we are going
to close our block and everyone's
gonna just open their door
and like walk out
and the kids can kick a
ball and can hit a ball.
That is so great for everyone.
I've seen a few parts of New
York where they do it now.
Like this is like in Manhattan by the way.
Like Chelsea somewhere there.
- Okay. - I remember driving
one day and I was irritated
because I was in the car trying to get
to an airport and the road was closed.
But I loved the fact that like,
I saw like someone hitting
a ball, a baseball,
and then people running the
whole street was just closed.
And I was like, oh, we've
been tricked into thinking the
thing that's right outside
our door is not a third space.
- No, but that's not a third space.
- Why is - Not it's a home.
Third spaces are like actual,
I'm talking about parks,
- Libraries.
- No, they have decimated
- Them.
I'm, I'm with you. And I'm telling you
that when I grew up, they didn't exist.
- Okay.
- Black kids couldn't go to a library.
- Oh yeah. You up
- There was no park.
There was no, during
apartheid, none of this exists.
But I have the full
childhood that you're talking about. Okay.
- Right. - Because the third
space was was the street.
The street. That's right.
I get what you mean.
If your grandmother told
you travel around the world,
sometimes you don't see girls,
but you always see boys
playing in the street.
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. The
third space is the street.
Yeah, that's right. So you go, you tell
- The kids, okay, go.
We need to get rid rid of these SUVs.
I would let my son play in the street if
- Americans didn't have
this huge off cars.
Exactly. You and you see, I
- Like if he runs in front of the
- Car.
Yes. But that's what I mean
by close the streets. Yeah.
- Yeah. - So I go, I would
love to live in a society
where we go, like we
used to do this on, I,
I wish I could like take you
to the picture in my brain.
We as the kids ran the
streets as if we were adults.
So we would close the street with bricks.
You take responsibility.
Yeah. We would take bricks
and we would put them at the beginning
of each road and close each
- Road. Yeah.
- And then when a car would
need to turn into the street.
'cause this is like a road,
you know, it's not a public,
I'm not talking about like main roads.
So if you're listening to this Yeah. No
permission about the highway.
Just an informal thing you did. Yes.
I'm not talking about a
highway, I'm not talking
about a main road.
I'm talking about like In
your neighborhood. Yeah.
Your neighborhood. It was a
township, but it was still a neighborhood.
But put bricks there.
A car would need to turn,
there would be kids
stationed at every corner
and you'd shout, you know, car.
Okay. And then you'd run there together.
You'd move the bricks,
move the bricks, let it
through everyone clear the road.
Yeah. Yeah. The car would
drive either through
where it needs to go to
or it would like stop at the
house that is stopping at.
And then we'd put the
bricks back on the road
and then we'd continue playing.
And because I agree with you,
I'm not saying like go play in the street,
but I'm saying sometimes
we look at problems in life
and they, they seem insurmountable
because we are looking
at them the wrong way.
Okay, no phones and no this and no,
and where now are we
gonna build third space?
How much is a third space?
Where do you get it?
How do we build a park? Do we get permits?
Do guys, everyone, if you are
lucky enough to have a house,
if you're lucky enough to
be renting a space, if you,
you literally have the third
space right outside your door.
- Yeah, that's
- Right. You just have to claim it back.
Yeah, that's right.
You literally just have
to claim it back collectively. Yeah. In
- His home, drugs and drink
were shadows never touched.
But one day Trevor's mother
offered him a cigarette
and a sip teaching him
that even temptation could
be faced with honesty.
- I think about growing up
and my perception of drugs.
So I didn't touch weed.
My whole I Okay, so I'll, I'll, I'll,
I'll even take it before even like drugs.
Drugs. My mom doesn't drink.
My mom doesn't smoke, my dad
doesn't drink, my dad doesn't smoke.
- Right.
- So I grew up in a
home where that wasn't a thing.
My grandmother, et cetera. Yeah.
And my mom said
to me when I was 13, 12, 13,
maybe even younger, she came to my room
and she had cigarettes And she had beer.
And she said to me, do you want, and,
and I was like, oh, this is a trap.
Obviously this is a trap.
And I was, I was almost disappointed.
And I was like, come on lady.
I'm gonna fall for a trap like that.
You're gonna come into my
room and offer me cigarettes.
And, and she was like, do you
want, do you want to try them?
And I was like, no, because
these are bad things
and we should never, and then
she said to me, listen honey,
you're gonna, you're
gonna encounter alcohol,
you're gonna encounter
cigarettes and things.
So if you're gonna use
it, I would rather know
that you use it and
then you use it at home.
- And then I don't worry
that now you are out
in the world using it,
you know, hiding it from me.
And then getting into situations
where you can't share
that you're, you are using
- It arm reduction.
- Exactly. It's amazing. Which is wild.
I I, my mom is, my mom
is like super religious
and super strict and
super, very progressive.
Yeah. And so then she didn't even know how
to like light a cigarette.
So we have to go, we have
to go to an uncle of mine.
And then he was like, tra what's up?
And she said he wants to try cigarettes.
And the guy was like,
okay, you want to smoke?
And he gave, gave us the
cigarettes and I puffed with him
and I was like, this is trash.
This is, so I was like, how
is the taste in your mouth?
You know what I mean? Yeah.
It, it, it tastes like,
someone's like eating
everything disgusting
and then farting it into
your, your your oral cavity.
And then the alcohol, beer just
tastes like, like old water
that has, you know,
dribble down a, a sewer
- Into I'm a bad bri.
I don't like, I don't like it
- Either.
So I, I didn't like any of that.
And then drugs was almost in the same
category for me. In fact.
- 'cause of that in initial experience.
- Yeah. In fact, drugs,
the way I grew up was,
you are a loser.
You are gonna end your life.
That's how I knew drugs.
- So that hasn't changed. Now
that was just when you caught up. That's,
- That's how I knew drugs,
that's all I was told.
These are the things that'll
happen when you take drugs.
So I didn't, I didn't touch weed.
I smoked weed for the
first time when I was 21.
- That's how like anti-drug.
I used to judge people
and I would look at them
and I would say to them, it is a pity
that you've chosen to
do this with your life.
I used to say that to my cousin
- In South Africa.
Thinness was not beauty. Not at all.
It was struggle to gain
weight was to be blessed.
Trevor recalls how the
meaning of a body can change
depending on where the story is told.
- Now I think that one of the things
that our whole fascination
with Ozempic is based on is,
and it's interesting,
you know, Christiana,
I wonder if you have thoughts
with little kids, right?
Part of beauty is thinness
as, as it's taught
to you from a really early age.
Like fatness, queerness, darkness, all
of these things are like
coded as signs of deviance.
I like you, you learn
as a really young child in
Disney movies in anything
like beauty is really coded as morality.
Right? Right. And there's this
protestant work ethic thing.
Right. It's something that you
should achieve through hard
and punitive work and discipline. Right?
- Yeah. - And when people
use ozempic, it's like, hmm,
you cheated, you skipped the
hard work part, you know?
Mm. Yeah. And so you, you got
the thing we demanded of you,
but now we find this a
vaguely immoral thinness.
- Like you worked hard to
achieve the right thing. Okay.
I I, I hear exactly, I
hear what you're saying.
It's funny because I,
I don't know how it was
for you growing up, but, so I have,
I've had an interesting
journey with weight
and how I perceive it
and fatness et cetera.
Because I grew up in South
Africa genuinely growing up.
This is such a weird thing to try
and explain to people in South
Africa, you did not get made
as much fun of if you were fat.
Like, so like a fat person,
you'd just be like, I mean,
I don't even remember if
we had that many names,
but I remember all the
ones for skinny people
who were six Zaza.
It was, that was my favorite one.
Sticks Zaza skinny man.
It was like, there were all these names
where it was just like,
you you, you are a twig.
You're thin. You, and
it was a sign there of,
of a lack of having,
- If you got married and
you didn't gain weight,
people would say that your
marriage is not going well.
Literally, they'd be like, is is your
wife not treating you well?
I man, no man, look at you.
If I would come home from the states,
and like many times I would,
I'd come back from
America and I gain weight.
And so whenever I go home,
people would be like, ah,
you're looking good man.
You're looking good.
America's treating you well.
You're looking Trevor. No.
And you're looking good.
Look at your cheeks, you're looking good.
And then, and, and,
and so where I grew up,
fatness was considered
like sort of a choice.
And then being skinny was like, whoa,
your life is not going well and you're not
making the right choices
- For sure.
- So it's interesting how
it, it flips, you know?
And I'm sure it's time as well
- As a child, Trevor learned
that even authority could be questioned
around the dinner table disagreement.
But new ways of seeing, he explores
how questioning can spark creativity.
- There's some classic research
looking at, at families,
looking at what does it take
to raise a creative child?
And it turns out that creative
children come from families
more often than not, that had regular
arguments and disagreements.
- Really?
So if you wanna a creative kid,
you can at least increase the probability.
I'm not sure if it's causal,
but by, by arguing with your
spouse a little bit more.
- What, what do you think that is?
I have an idea, but I'd love
to know what you think that
- Is.
Well, I wanna hear your hunch
before I, I tell you what
I think. 'cause I've, I've,
- Okay, so I'm
- Thinking about this for a long time. So,
So here's what I think it is.
I think the reason children
who grew up in houses
that are a little more
argumentative might be a little more
creative is
because they're existing in an environment
where there isn't one way to think.
And so what happens is they're
both stumbling on what I like
to call third thoughts, right?
I had this, like, this
idea when I was working on
the daily show with my team.
And I'd say, I think everyone
has a thought, right?
And then like, you can
have a second thought even
by yourself, but I think there's
this elusive third thought
that can only come from two
different thoughts clashing
together and forming a third thought
that isn't from one specific place.
Yes. And so I think if
you are watching people
who don't agree as a child,
people who you generally love
or you care for, et cetera,
you are listening to a person
and you are agreeing with them maybe,
or just seeing their point of view.
You're looking at another
person agreeing with them
and seeing their point of view.
And then maybe you are holding
both including a third,
which might be yours, which
is another opinion of it.
And that might force your brain to think
of more things than just
the things that exist,
which I think is what
creativity fundamentally is.
- I love this. Okay,
so, so your theory is,
cognitive complexity comes
from seeing people argue.
- That you don't
- Default to, I need to
remember all the, you,
you make like some of my
ideas sound way smarter
and fancier than they are, which I like
cognitive complexity.
Write that down. Alright. Alright.
- I just give you terms for
things you already know.
- Okay. Okay. Okay, cool.
- I also think you learn
to be a non-conformist
through that same process.
- Oh, interesting.
- That instead of just defaulting
or deferring to whatever an
authority figure tells you,
you realize, well there are two
different authorities in the
room and they don't agree.
And you, I I think that can both lead
to cognitive complexity,
but it can also lead
to more courage when it comes
to challenging the status quo.
'cause there's not a right
answer coming from above.
- There is not one coming from above.
- Yep.
- You know what's funny?
You say this, my mom is very religious,
extremely, extremely religious.
But I also think she is one
of the most progressive thinkers I've ever
come across in my lifetime.
And one thing I always
noticed as a child was
how sometimes she would
disagree with the sermon
that the pastor gave
when we'd leave church.
And I'd be like, huh. And I'm just a kid.
I'm just sitting in the
passenger seat listening
and she goes, I didn't agree with that.
I didn't, I didn't, I I, I hear
where the pastor was coming from,
but I think he was that, that
story of Joseph is not about,
and then she'd go into her thing and,
and then I'd be like,
but he's the pastora.
And she's like, yeah, he's
a guy who reads the Bible.
- He's not God.
- Yeah, but he's not God.
He is like, we also have the Bible.
And it was an interesting way for me
to view even religion is
going like, huh, don't assume
that the person who
stands on the pulpits has
like monopoly on knowledge.
You too have the book that you can read.
And so now that makes me wonder.
Now I'm like, huh, was
that part of me? You know?
Okay. I like this.
- I I like it too. I mean you can see
both of those effects playing
- Out. Yeah, yeah, definitely.
- You're not just gonna assume
that the pastor's answer is gospel.
- And then you're also not gonna be afraid
to question what somebody in power says.
- Travel was part of the first generation
to sit in classrooms of class color lines.
The fragile experiment, very
fragile if I'm to be honest
with you, shaped by apartheid shadow.
He recalls what it meant to grow up in
that moment of change.
- You know, I I I was
talking to a, a friend
of mine the other day, Dale,
and we were talking about how
at our school they had a program where,
because we were the first generation
that was like literally I, you
and I were the first generation.
How old are you, Dan?
- 31.
- 31. Yeah.
So we were the first generation
of kids that went to school
with kids of a different race.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Literally. I sometimes think about
how crazy that was when I go,
like literally the first year in my school
that there were black kids,
Indian kids, colored kids
with white kids.
That was the first time
that it ever happened.
- You guys were round one,
you were the first child.
We were literally not on experiments.
- Yo our teachers so wrong.
Our teachers had never
seen a black child in front
of them in a classroom before.
- Our parents had to
wear their Sunday past
for the first drop off, drop
- Off.
- Our parents didn't even know what a drop
off was. I mean, drop
- Off life.
No, but the think about, just
think about that as a concept.
I remember being shocked
that when I went to school,
kids were dropped off
by their parents in a
vehicle that they owned.
Like one child got out of one
- Car. Mm.
- Meanwhile when the black kids got there,
it looked like a circus
trick where like one car
and they'd open a door and
- Then like, so many,
- You're 15.
Mm. You, and and that's how we
just traveled around the back
of every bucky the back of
every van was all of us.
You know what I mean? But that exposure,
like our school had this
program where they went,
we want every kid to go
and stay at another kid's
house who they're friends with.
They weren't even like, they
weren't like a stranger.
- Yeah. - But they said,
Hey, you guys are friends.
But it was a deliberate program. Yo.
- It was amazing to see
to talking about like exposure therapy.
It was amazing to see how
the black kids weren't
particularly surprised
by what they experienced
because many of them had
moms who were working
for white people.
So they had seen a glimpse of a white life
- That makes sense of it. Yeah, for sure.
- Lemme tell you something.
Every single white kid who went
to go and live with a
black family for a weekend,
every single one of them went
home and said the same thing.
They said, mom and dad, do you
know how black people live?
And not in like a, a righteous
way, just as like a child,
- Like a way,
- Like a 14-year-old, 15-year-old.
They went, yo, do you, do
you know how they live?
Do you know how they
come to school every day?
Do you know that they have to
take three buses to get here
with other people, with rangers?
Do you know that they
don't have hot water in
the morning at their house?
You you have to make a
fire and then heat it up
and then they call stove
out and then you have
to do it again for each person.
And they have to, you know, they all,
they don't have their
own bathrooms, you know,
that their toilet's outside.
I go to school with this kid.
I see myself as his direct
like competition in that way.
- But I'm going, how is he doing math?
When he woke up like that
- In the spinning of a simple roundabout,
young Trevor found joy in
bringing people together.
He uncovers how that
childhood game revealed the
purpose guiding his life.
Oh yeah.
- Okay. Tell me an early specific
happy childhood memory.
Something I can relive with you.
- An early
- Specific
- Specific happy childhood memory.
Childhood memory. Yeah. Damn,
this is an interesting one.
Let me think. 'cause there's many, how,
how old gimme an age and
I'll tell you I don't care.
No, but what, what, when does
childhood end forties two.
- Okay. No, no, I'm being serious though.
I want when you're, when
you're, you know, a child,
like under, you know, in, in school like a
- Okay, my
- Early childhood memory,
- One of my happiest childhood
memories is me the only one
who's ever asked me What do you mean by
- Childhood?
- Yes. Because because I think
because I think your memories of different
ages are very Yeah,
- Definitely. Early specific childhood
- Memories.
Yeah. So, okay. When I
think of young, young, one
of my favorite memories
was playing on the,
on the roundabouts at
a park near my house.
- Yeah. This is something a a specific
time, not just a thing you did.
No, no, no. This is one time
a specific one. Okay. Yeah. Go
- On.
And we were all seeing how
we were all teaming up.
I got a bunch of people together to see
how fast we could make this thing spin.
But like, it was, it
was a monumental effort.
Do you know what I mean? Because
everyone had to be at the
right place swinging the thing
at the right time to get it.
Our goal was to make it
fly. That was the dream.
We thought if we spin it hard
enough, it's gonna take off.
And this, this was a,
but that was one of my,
when I think back I go like,
wow, what a day. What a
- Day.
And of all the amazing things
you had happen in this magical
childhood that you've talked about,
what specifically was
it about this one thing
that stands out so much that
you wanna talk about it now?
- It's collaboration. I
chose the people I was doing it with.
We didn't pick the random kids
who in you had no coordination.
'cause the things are gonna
smack you in the hands. Right.
So we got the strongest,
fastest, smartest, like,
you know, most affable.
We put the people together
and we were like, this works.
So it wasn't like, if
you were the small kid,
then your job might have been
to be more on the inside.
If you were the big kid,
your job was to push.
But we put people together and
it, it matched in many ways.
Right. And the most important
thing, funny enough,
Simon Sinek, the most important thing
was that we were having fun.
And I mean this genuinely we were having,
- We had a purpose, but
man, we were having fun.
- So you, so so now what
I'm doing is I'm looking
for the connection between those things.
Yes. And saying, okay, that's
the common factor, right.
Which is you, the
where you find great joy is
when you can bring the right
people together to do
something that matters
and have a, a ton of fun doing it.
- That's, yes.
- Okay. And that's sort of your,
your purpose in life, which
is to bring people together
to do something bigger than themselves
and have a good time doing it.
- And if everything you do in your life,
you can Is is that, is
that, is that, yeah,
- Roundabout.
That roundabout mer go. We
got to call Mery go-round.
- Yeah. The the, and everything in your
life was like that roundabout.
You, you, that is what a game on is. Yeah.
And so the opportunity for you is
to remind yourself of that.
Right. So I, whether you
get a Lego merry-go-round
or a picture of a merry-go-round,
or just you that merry-go-round.
Oh, this is, I like, this is,
I like sentimental things.
Right. This is the merry go-round is it's
your, it's your talisman.
It's your, it's your, it's the thing
that reminds you of why you get outta bed
- Today. Hmm.
- All you wanna do in
life is work tirelessly
to create the merry-go-round.
Right. And, and the thing is, is
because you're, you have vision.
We're gonna make this
thing fly. Yeah. Okay.
So people go, huh?
And you go, you, you,
you and you. Yeah. Okay.
And now they're all coming
in and you're having a blast.
And whether it succeeds
or fails, it didn't fly.
- It did not fly. It
- Did not fly.
It did not, it did not fly.
So it actually failed if we're
really honest with ourselves.
Yeah. But it didn't matter
because it was the joy
of the together and the fun.
Even with the vision that made it worth,
you'd never said at any point,
and I fricking nailed it. No,
- That's not the
- Point.
Right. The point wasn't the result.
No. The point was the people coming
- To the outcome is a
bonus. I always say this,
- The outcome is a bonus.
And so this chapter ends,
childhood stories fade,
but the lessons remain carrying us
until we meet again.

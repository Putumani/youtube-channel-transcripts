That's the only way I get back into like
sort of shape is I I have to put weights
next to my bed. That's literally what
I'll do.
Do you go to sleep in your gym clothes,
too?
No, no, no, no. Cuz you you This is
actually a myth. You don't need gym
clothes to work out. This is a complete
fallacy. You can do it naked. It works
just as well. In fact, it makes me feel
like I'm like in like ancient Greece or
something. Yeah. Yeah, there's like a
moment where you lift a weight above
your head and you're completely naked
and you're just like, "Yes, I am
Spartacus."
This is What Now with Trevor Noah.
It's fun having you. Welcome. Welcome to
the podcast.
I'm excited to be here.
Yeah, man. I'm really happy to have you
here because like like I I love how you
think, but then I also love the science
behind how you think. Some people know
your books or your TED talks, but what
I've noticed is some people know you as
like they think of you as a as a
researcher. They go, "That's what that
guy does." And then some people think of
you as as really a social scientist and
a psychologist and somebody who looks at
human interactions.
How would you define what you actually
do?
I I mean, I guess I'd say I'm an
organizational psychologist.
Okay. And I'm interested in how we can
improve the quality of our lives at work
and beyond.
Is it just like business organizations
or any like how how big does an
organization get before it's no longer
an organization?
I think if it's fewer than two people,
it's definitely not an organization.
So it's the Lord's rules basically.
Maybe.
Yeah. Cuz he said that as well. He said,
"What? When three or more gathered in my
name, then I'm in their presence."
That's
I'm going to take your word for it.
Yeah. Well,
I haven't had any conversations with the
Lord, so
Well, it's in the Bible. It's in the
That's one of my favorite like lines in
the Bible. I like that the Lord is like,
"Look, man, there's like two of you. You
should probably go to church. If there's
three of you, I'll come to you."
Fascinating. I didn't know there was a
biblical theory of team size or
gathering.
Actually, maybe then let me let me start
with asking you that. Is there a science
behind the number of people who come
together then increasing their ability
to connect with something more powerful
or spiritual?
Well, thinking out loud, there there a
couple things that come to mind. Yeah.
The first one is I'm thinking of
Durkheim, the the founding father of
sociology who wrote about collective
effervescence, which is a lot of
syllables for the feeling of energy and
purpose that you have when you come
together in a group for something larger
than yourself.
Say that again. The feeling of
energy and purpose
that you have when coming together
collectively in a group for the same
reason though.
Yes. With a with a common goal.
Oh, I like this. Wait, is this So, is
this the same as like Roman soldiers
being able to march further when they
were marching together? possibly.
Okay. And do we know why that is?
I think we know we know a little bit.
There's there's actually a hilarious
experiment where people had to sing O
Canada uh either in unison or not and
then they ended up cooperating more
afterward if they had been in tune
together.
Oh man. Now then it seems like national
anthems have a purpose in a weird way.
They might like beyond just I thought it
was just like a love song to the
country. Well, I mean, I think you made
the case that Sweet Caroline is better
than our national anthem at bringing
people together.
I think it is. I think
hysterical, by the way.
Thank you very much. I think it's I
think it's one of the uh one of the
greatest I actually think that's what we
should do. I think every country should
change its national anthem every few
years just to like keep it fresh and
keep it like keep up with the times and
the vibes, you know what I mean? And
then, you know, like Yeah. Like Sweet
Caroline could have been a national
anthem, I think, for a while, you know?
How would you choose? You just see what
people like. It's like how do they
choose the charts?
That's This would be so much fun.
Yeah. I mean, we just listen to the
music and then we go like, "All right,
hey, new national anthem, you know? It's
like, all right, Taylor Swift has a
great one and then Beyonce has another
great one." And then we just like go
down a list and we choose like amazing
songs. Sometimes you unear them from way
back in the day. You know,
what I love about this is then you would
get people a little bit more comfortable
with changing old traditions and then it
wouldn't be a far cry to say we should
have a new constitutional convention.
Damn, you just took it there.
I mean,
I don't touch the Constitution. Let me
tell you something. Now, Adam Grant, I
want you to know you don't bring that to
my podcast. The Constitution is the way
the Constitution was, and it'll always
will be. All right? Anyone else who's
watching this, you know that I believe
in the Constitution, and it stays the
way it should, especially all those
amendments. You don't change those
amendments. How dare you? You you you're
a big fan of change. I mean I I think
that the world changes and we have a
choice about whether we want to evolve
with it or whether we want to become
obsolete.
Okay. So let's let's try climb this
mountain together. Somebody who is
pro-change is how I assume you are you
know from reading you listening to you
etc.
Depends on the change.
Okay. Okay. Okay. So then let's start
with that. When do you or when do you
think someone should change their mind?
Because on like I always go like you
should always be willing to change. And
for me personally as Trevor I go I
always assume that I could be wrong. It
doesn't matter what it is. I just always
assume that I could be wrong and then I
go from there including about that.
Yeah. Okay. I think that change is not
always good. Right. We have to be clear
about that. Um sometimes it backfires.
Sometimes it has unintended
consequences. We're living with a lot of
them right now. And your show is about
that in some ways.
Right. Yeah. I think I think the reasons
for change are really important. So, a
lot of people change to gain social
approval and
plump.
Oh, wow.
Well, I saw that coming and I couldn't
jump quick enough.
Sorry about Well, it's
And it's right out of shot.
But it's out of shot. Sorry.
That's hilarious.
You You're going to just have to leave
it for now. I guess
you deal with this change. You got to
run with this metaphor here.
It's uh Yeah. Not all change is good.
That's what you were saying, right?
I Maybe that
I didn't know you bring props. I didn't
know you bring props to your interviews.
You brought the prop.
That's uh that's really well played.
Thank you.
So So going back No, no. So going back
um
why do you change?
Yeah. Why why do you change or when do
you know that you should change?
I think for me the starting point is to
say most people base what they want to
what they want to change and what what
they want to keep constant on their
identity. and their identity is a set of
beliefs about what's true.
I think that's a mistake. I think who
you are is not a question of what you
believe. It's a question of what you
value. So, not what are your truths, but
rather what are your principles?
What are your truths? What are your
Wait, wait, wait, forgive me. It sounds
like the same thing. Help me break it
down.
So, um let's uh let's let's actually
let's talk about you, Trevor. Let's talk
about one of your core beliefs. Give me
a policy that you think is necessary or
effective
that is necessary
or effective
or effective or that we should have that
fairness. Okay.
The way taxes um are doowled out for
people's education in America for
children's education I don't think
should be by zip code. I think somebody
should try and find an algorithm or like
a system that basically just breaks it
up equally and every school gets the
same money because otherwise people have
created little little enclaves where the
money ends up. And so even though it's a
public school and everyone's proud of
that, oh my child goes to a public
school, you've made it a private school
by locking it into the zip code where
the school accepts people from. Do you
know what I mean? So for me, that policy
I would change. I would go, no, we find
a system where the money all comes
together and then it just gets like
spread out equally and then every school
is getting the same amount of resources
as opposed to schools getting money
based on who's the richest people who
live near it.
Okay, good. So you have a belief that
equal distribution of resources to
schools is a good idea.
Yes. I think it's a better idea than
what than what it is now.
Now what's the value behind that? Why do
you want to do that?
I don't even think about people being
smarter. I don't even think I just think
if if everybody has access to a thing,
then they're more likely to be in sync
with each other because in a way we've
given them all access to O Canada as an
education system and so they're more
likely to feel like they are together
when they go out into the world.
Okay. So the value you're describing is
community, solidarity, belonging.
That's your value.
Okay. Now your belief is you have a
particular way of getting us there. Yes.
That might or might not be true.
That is true.
And so if you stay open to questioning
the belief, you're interested in
whatever is the best policy to serve
your value.
Oh.
And that allows you to learn and change.
Okay.
But don't change the value.
No. No. This makes a lot of sense
because I should be open to the idea
that equally distributing the thing is
wrong.
Yeah. Exactly. But I still wish to
create a society where people are
generous and connected and living in a
community.
Nailed it. Look at that.
Ah, I like this. You should you should
teach.
you should you should go to a university
and like be a professor or something.
I I might need a recommendation from
you. I'll be like, can I get a Trevor
reference for that job?
You know, I So, I I've always wondered
this about you. when when you have this
much data in your head and this much
science, does it make it harder to move
through the world with people who are
operating completely from like um like I
don't want to say flawed, but what's the
biggest thing that what's like your pet
peeve when you talk to people?
Astrology.
H
astrology. You don't believe in
astrology.
I mean technically I shouldn't believe
or disbelieve, right? I have a set of
values.
You don't Wow. around scientific inquiry
and I think the science casts a lot of
doubt on it. Okay, look, okay, I'm I'm
skeptical of astrology, right? But I'm a
Pisces, so that's my nature. Do you know
what I mean? But I'm saying like you
Okay, so let's let's get into
Are you really a Pisces?
Yeah, I really am.
Do you think that has any meaning?
Um, okay. So this is this is the thing.
Do I believe in astrology? No. I I have
this romantic idea that there is a
possibility that something did affect
people, but I don't necessarily know
what it is. Maybe it's January people.
Maybe we're like giving it star signs,
but I keep thinking like maybe if you're
born at the end of the year, you have a
different vibe because like you're born
around like end of the year like people
have a different vibe at the end of the
year, right? And maybe you live a
different life because you know I think
like Malcolm Gladwell did like some of
that work. It's like you also get into
the schooling system at a different
time. So maybe you act different, you
feel different, you are different. So
maybe our star signs are just like a woo
woo way of tapping into something that
might be scientific. Now, do I believe
it tells you what's going to happen in
the next month? No, I don't. But I go
like, "Ooh, there's something here." So
interesting to hear you talk about it.
So I think you're you're talking about
it like a scientist would. And what
drives me crazy about people's stances
on astrology is they come in as
preachers, not scientists.
Okay. Okay. So what what separates a a
preacher from a scientist?
So a preacher is basically proitizing
their existing views.
Mhm.
And a scientist is trying to find the
truth, not spread it.
Okay. So wait, I I've heard you talk a
little bit about this before. Let's
let's break down some. So there's
preachers, there are politicians, and
then there is
prosecutors.
Prosecutors. Okay. Okay. Okay. So
preachers, you're going out there.
You're basically saying this is what I
believe in, and everyone should believe
in it with me. Okay. Politicians.
In politician mode, basically you're
saying, uh, I'm not even going to bother
to listen to you unless you already
agree with what I think.
Oh, damn. Okay. And then prosecutor.
Prosecutor is my biggest problem. So,
this is what happens whenever someone
tries to give me a horoscope is I start
to just smack it down with data.
Oh, you you like you're a pro. You have
a problem being a prosecutor.
A huge problem. Um, I've been called a
logic bully, Trevor. And
you think that's funny? My wife had to
explain that's not a compliment.
Oh yeah. No, I know it's not a
compliment. That's what I think is
hilarious.
What do you What do you mean people
don't want to be hammered with facts and
studies?
Oh man. And I love this.
Have you gotten better at this? Are you
able to like hold yourself when somebody
sometimes
sometimes I mean I I met I talked to
somebody the other day who was
interested in exploring ideas and
finding out what's true not preaching or
Yes. Yes. Yes. And you know, I got a
like, well, what's what's your sign?
Like, I need to know your sign to
understand you. And I just I launched
into a huge rant. I couldn't resist.
That's hilarious. Wait. Okay. Wait. So,
now let me ask you this. As an
organizational psychologist, as somebody
who studies people, that is an instance
that a lot of people might be able to
laugh at and go, "Man, this is funny.
That's hilarious. I can't believe that
happened." etc. But I feel like in the
world we're living in today, as people
are getting more access to a more what I
would call like a niche existence,
it's your for you feed, it's your
algorithm, it's your way of seeing the
world. Is there any science or is there
a proven way to bridge the gap between
yourself and somebody else? Especially
let's start with people you care about.
Someone you care about who holds a view
that you as you said you would make you
launch a rant against it. Like you go
like I cannot believe you hold this view
knowing you as a human being the way I
thought I did. So ideally what what you
start with is you say okay I'm feeling
the strong temptation to preach and
prosecute and I want to think more like
a scientist here. Don't let your ideas
become your identity.
Okay. So a good scientist would have the
humility to know what they don't know
and the curiosity to keep seeking new
knowledge.
And the way you start doing that is you
say, "Huh, what an interesting
specimen."
I mean, don't say that out loud.
But I think I was like, "Okay, this is
not going to help build your
friendship." Okay. Okay.
No, but the the more the more somebody
holds a different opinion, the less you
understand about how they think.
Even if you're offended by what they
think. And that means you have to want
to know more.
So, you've got a couple options. I think
the first one is to just establish that
two reasonable intelligent people can
actually disagree and that's okay. A
second is what I love to do is I I love
to ask and this is when I remember to do
it. It leads to a much better
conversation.
Like, okay Trevor, so like you called
yourself a Pisces. That's so interesting
to me that you would put any stock in
something that I think has no evidence
behind it.
What evidence would change your mind?
Hm.
And then what what what happens? What
follows?
Well, usually people start to map out,
well, this is the kind of study I would
need to see. And then they're on my
turf.
Oh, damn. So, you're out here laying
logic traps
a little bit.
The the logic bully has turned into the
logic hunter. He's like like Adam's out
in the you're out in the forest like
laying out logic traps.
The traps are better than
let's let's play this game out now.
Let's try this again in a benign topic.
Let's go with astrology. Now, and I'm
saying this to you and I mean this
completely. Honestly, I do not believe
in it. However, what would you need from
me to accept that astrology might have
some merits?
The first thing I I would want you to do
is is to read the science that has
convinced me that it doesn't have any
merit.
So, I would say let's let's just throw
out a few simple data points and I'm
going to try really hard not to logic
bully here.
No, no, go. You can't bully me cuz I'm
asking for it. If I say if I say pull my
underwear, then I'm now a willing
participant. There's no bullying here.
This is just two consenting adults, one
pulling the other one's underwear up out
of their pants.
Fair.
So, please logic wedging.
Intellectual wedgie. Here we go.
Um, okay. So, there's a psychology piece
and then there's an astrophysics piece.
Where do you want to go first?
Okay, let's go psychology first.
Okay, so psychology first. So, there's a
huge study by um led by Jackson Lee at
MIT. uh it's over 160,000 people where
you get their astrological sign and then
you also have them fill out a a long
personality questionnaire.
And it turns out there is literally a
zero correlation between any of the
signs and any personality trait that you
can think of.
Wow. Zero. Zero.
Like on a 1:7 scale um like Capricorns
and Pisces would come out 5.62 versus
5.63 on how agreeable and friendly they
are. And every trait and every sign goes
like that.
Zero.
This is devastating.
Here's the thing. When you share this
evidence with astrology fans, what they
do is they say, "Well, I need your whole
natal chart because it's not enough to
just know your zodiac sign."
Which is true because I mean, the moon
also affects and where was Venus? Where
was Venus? This is a very key question.
Not in the picture clearly, but that's
where you then start to go to
astrophysics. And I'm not an
astrophysicist, right? So, I'm I should
be careful here. It's pretty clear that
there the the gravitational force that
the sun, the moon, and the stars exert
on us is so infiniteimally small that it
would almost be impossible to measure
it. The force of any celestial objects
on your body is smaller than the force
your own pillow exerts when you go to
sleep at night.
Damn.
And you said you're a Pisces, Trevor.
Yeah.
Turns out because of the Earth's wobble,
you're not even the sign that you think
you are, which hasn't been accounted for
in the last couple thousand years.
I'm I'm sorry. Say that again. The earth
wobbles
because the earth has wobbled. People
aren't the star sign that they are.
They think they are.
How much have has it moved by?
I think I I don't I don't actually know.
This is not my expertise. I think you
might be one sign off.
I knew it. I'm an Aquarius. I could feel
You know what? I felt a change a few
years ago and I was like, but I I'm
Pisces. This makes a lot of sense.
Clearly, you've just you've just helped
me use the science to get back into
No. No. We're going to continue this
conversation right after this short
break.
Do you think it's more important to be
right or do you think it's more
important to get along with other
people?
Ideally, for me, a healthy relationship
is one in which people recognize great
minds do not think alike. They challenge
each other to think again.
Uhhuh.
And if we can't question each other and
we can't disagree, then we actually
don't have a lot of respect for each
other. Oh, that's interesting.
Like, I don't respect your ability to
learn and your willingness to consider
different views if I'm not open to
putting something out there that you
might object to.
You know, it's it's funny in in um in
one of the episodes we had Gerard
Carmichael on and we're talking about
his TV show and how he came out as gay
and he'd been struggling to get his
family to accept him as an openly gay
man. And one of the things we disagreed
on, we're still friends, but one of the
things we disagreed on is how he went
about it. So, he went slamming it in
their face,
showing my mom, this is my boyfriend,
showing my dad like pics of my boyfriend
in his underwear and you know what I
mean? Now, personally, personally as
Trevor, I don't agree with that. And I
get where Gerard's coming from and he
said like this is the only way I could
get my family to change. He knows his
family better than I do. So, I go like,
"All right, I'll defer to you." But the
thing I said to him was, I find, I'm not
a scientist, nor am I a psychologist,
but I find
one of the biggest things that hurts us
in society today is that we
it's sort of like we um how can I put
it? If we spend all our time butting up
against the thing that that that we
disagree on, I was I almost feel like we
form a callous with each other as human
beings. And then that becomes the thing
that we meet on every single time. Well,
well, if it isn't Mr. Pisces, ah, if it
isn't Mr. Science. And now I no longer
see you as Adam. And so I I sometimes
wonder, and maybe maybe you've got, you
know, something to back this up. Or
maybe I'm wrong. I sometimes wonder if
the key to bridging those divides is not
by hitting them headon, but it's by
fortifying the other parts of our of our
connection that make us more likely to
trust each other in the parts where we
don't get along. Does this make sense?
It makes a ton of sense. This is
fascinating. Okay, so I have a couple
reactions. First one is uh a callus
protects your hands.
Right. So it's it's a buildup of I don't
even What is it? I guess it's just skin
that dies and I don't know. I'm I'm not
a anything. But yeah,
but it prevents you from bleeding,
right? There's a there's a protective
layer on there.
And so I I actually wonder if the
opposite is true.
If we if we invested in other parts of
our relationships, we would increase uh
there's a term for it actually. It's
called tensility.
Um which I had never heard. Um my mentor
Jane Dutton gave me the term. It's it's
basically the the carrying capacity of a
relationship. Oh, I like that. Like
tensile strength.
Yeah. To bend without breaking. Okay.
Um and
I think you could say, yeah, the more we
invest in the relationship, the more we
build it,
right?
But
for some reason, whatever we've been
doing to invest in our relationships in
the last decade was not enough. Like
people didn't used to fight about
politics, I think, pre205 the way they
do now.
And we've still watched a lot of
relationships fall apart. Mhm.
Think about how many in the US
Thanksgiving dinners were just
shattered.
So, I actually wonder if we're making in
some ways the opposite mistake. We say,
you know, that's that's not important
enough to have the argument.
I want to keep the peace. I don't want
to damage the relationship. And so, we
never build the calluses for the big
ones. You you're almost going to an
earlier stage. You're saying
because we don't spend enough time
challenging each other on the small
things, we're not prepared when the big
things come around for a constructive
and let's say respectful dialogue.
Exactly. But if you if you think about
it for a second, it's I mean in any
other domain of life, we would assume
you have to practice when the stakes are
low in order to be prepared for the high
situation.
But I think so often people are told,
you know, just compromise, pick your
battles in relationships that they end
up treating them as as fragile as
opposed to saying, "No, we we've
actually got to learn how to disagree."
And in fact, there's um there's some
classic research looking at um at
families, uh looking at what does it
take to raise a creative child? And it
turns out that creative children come
from families more often than not uh
that had regular arguments and
disagreements. really.
Yeah. So, um if you want to raise a
creative kid, um you can at least
increase the probability. I'm not sure
if it's causal, but by by arguing um
with your spouse a little bit more.
What What do you think that is? I have
an idea, but I'd love to know what you
think that is.
Well, I want to hear your hunch before I
I tell you what I think cuz I've for a
long time.
Okay. So, here's what I think it is.
I think the reason children who grow up
in houses that are a little more
argumentative might be a little more
creative is because they're existing in
an environment where there isn't one way
to think. And so what happens is they're
both stumbling on what I like to call
third thought, right? I had this like
this idea when I was working on the
Daily Show with my team and I'd say I
think everyone has a thought, right? And
then like you can have a second thought
even by yourself, but I think there's
this elusive third thought that can only
come from two different thoughts
clashing together and forming a third
thought that isn't from one specific
place. And so I think if you are
watching people who don't agree as a
child, people who you generally love or
you care for, etc., you are listening to
a person and you are agreeing with them
maybe or just seeing their point of
view. You're looking at another person
agreeing with them and seeing their
point of view and then maybe you are
holding both including a third which
might be yours which is another opinion
of it and that might force your brain to
think of more things than just the
things that exist which I think is what
creativity fundamentally is.
I love this. Okay. So, so your theory is
cognitive complexity comes from seeing
people argue that you don't
I need to remember all the you you make
like some of my ideas sound way smarter
and fancier than they are which I like.
Cognitive complexity. Write that down.
All right.
I just give you terms for things you
already know.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Cool.
I also think you learn to be a
non-conformist through that same
process.
Oh, interesting.
That instead of just defaulting or
deferring to whatever an authority
figure tells you, you realize, well,
there are two different authorities in
the room and they don't agree. And you I
I think that can both lead to cognitive
complexity, but it can also lead to more
courage when it comes to challenging the
status quo
because there's not a right answer
coming from. There's not one coming from
above.
You know, it's funny you say this. My
mom is very religious. Extremely
extremely religious. But I also think
she is one of the most progressive
thinkers I've ever come across in my
lifetime. And one thing I always noticed
as a child was how sometimes she would
disagree with the sermon that the pastor
gave when we'd leave church. And I'd be
like, "Huh?" And I'm just a kid. I'm
just sitting in the passenger seat
listening. And she goes, "I didn't agree
with that." Mm-m. I didn't I didn't I I
I hear where the pastor was coming from,
but I think he was that that story of
Joseph is not about. And then she'd go
into her thing and and then I'd be like,
"But he's the pastor." And she's like,
"Yeah, he's a guy who reads the Bible.
He's not God."
Yeah, but he's not God. He's like, "We
also have the Bible." And it was an
interesting way for me to view even
religion is going like, "Huh, don't
assume that the person who stands on the
pullpit
has like a monopoly on knowledge.
You too have the book that you can
read." And so now that makes me wonder
now. I'm like, "Huh, was that part of
me?" You know, w Okay, I like this.
I I like it, too. I mean, you can see
both of those effects playing out.
You're not just going to assume that the
pastor's answer is gospel,
right? And then you're also not going to
be afraid to question what somebody in
power says.
So, how do you
if you're a parent? You're a parent.
I've met your daughter. Actually, one
one of my favorite things I've I've
encountered is you arguing with your
daughter.
I don't even remember this.
You don't remember this? It was really
fun. So, um I don't remember what it was
about. I wish I did, but the two of you
were having a discussion and she said,
"I think it's this." And you said, "Why
do you think it's that?" And you're
like, "I don't know if I don't know if I
agree with you." And then I was like,
"Actually, I agree with her." And I
really did. I wasn't trying to stir
or anything. She had a a respect for
you, but not like a not like a fear. So,
have you have you encourage that in your
daughter? Have you gone like, "Hey,
argue me like on everything, or how does
or does she just see it from you?"
I I I've tried to encourage it, but it
it's going to happen whether I do or
not.
Right. Because she I'm assuming she just
observes this.
Yeah. I mean, she sees me getting things
wrong all the time, and so how can you
not speak up about that?
Oh, I like that. But I will say, you
know, so you haven't met my wife
Allison, but uh during co we did
something that we'd never tried before,
which is we said, okay, we want to we
want to create a household where our
kids are willing to, you know,
constructively disagree and debate
things. We also want to raise a family
in which um you know, they they can
admit their mistakes and not be ego
defensive about what they did wrong.
So, we're going to we sat down at family
dinner one night and we said, um, we're
going to go around and each say
something we want to do better, and then
we're going to ask everybody else to
give us notes basically on how we can
improve. And we did it first.
And we we anticipated some of what our
kids told us, not everything, but it it
was it was such a powerful conversation
because I think for the I never thought
to do this before, although like we do
this at work all the time, right? bosses
are supposed to ask their teams, "How
can I improve?"
Um, I'd never seen parents do that with
their kids before. And one of the notes
that that Joanna gave me was that I
needed to be less stubborn.
And I was like, I literally just
published a book about changing your
mind.
And then Elena jumped in and was like,
"You need to think again, Dad."
Oh, that's funny.
And I was like, "Oh, who am I writing
this book for? It's for me because I
need to internalize my own message." But
I I do think that look, some some people
they think this is, you know, gentle
parenting gone overboard. Like I don't
want to ask my kids how I can be a
better parent.
I'm like, I don't know a better way to
model to them that we're all works in
progress and we all get things wrong and
we all have to work on ourselves than
that.
Was there something where you like
disagreed and you were like, "Nope, I
don't agree with your assessment."
Yes. Uh when we got to the We should all
have smartphones.
Nice. Nice. had to set a boundary there.
Now, okay, so now let's talk about that
boundary because I think a lot of
parents will relate to this.
Your kids go, "Hey, I think you're wrong
about us not having smartphones." You
go, "Nope, we we do not think that we're
wrong." Like, how are you making that
decision and what are you basing it on?
Well, I think look, I think the evidence
is really messy and there are lots of
conflicting findings. Even some of the
the most knowledgeable experts on this
topic don't agree on what policies
should be. I think that two things
jumped out at me. The first one is um
there was a study showing that the the
earlier kids got smartphones um the
younger they were when they got their
first one uh the lower their self-esteem
um the more emotional challenges they
faced even going into young adulthood.
Now is that is that causal? We don't
know. Um it could be that parents who
were lax were lax in lots of different
ways,
but that's concerning to me.
Damn. And then there was just a great um
a great experiment in Scandinavia
showing that when smartphones were
banned from schools, uh kids not only
got better grades, but they also had
better relationships
and their social skills improved more.
And so I think there's enough evidence
to suggest that there are aspects of
smartphones that may not be a net
positive for kids that like a flip phone
or a watch is probably good until high
school.
Yeah. like I'm so so I'm on I'm on a
journey of trying to defonify my life
right now.
How's that working for you?
It's actually going well. So So what
I've realized is the the gift of the
modern smartphone is is also its curse
and it's that everything is in one
place. And so I'm not saying it is bad,
but I just go the collection of
everything is actually a curse at times,
you know. So it's like imagine if your
imagine if everything that you kept in
your house food wise was in the exact
same place. I mean like cake, cupcakes,
milk, eggs, bread, you know, beans, you
name, but was all in the same place.
Think about how much more likely you
would be to eat a bag of Doritos if like
it was in the fridge. Do you know what I
mean? And so like I think there's like a
weird thing. We we've even done this as
humans where we've gone like, "All
right, that's a snacks cupboard." So,
you know that if you open that there'll
be snacks, but if you put the snacks
everywhere else, there's a high
likelihood or a higher I think that
you're going to get sucked in. And I
think the same thing goes for the
smartphone, right? It's like we we have
this thing.
This is really good.
And you go into one part of it and then
all of a sudden you're in another part
of it and you're like, "Wait, what?
What? How did I get here? What was I
doing? How did I So, I what I'm trying
to do right now is I'm trying to
defonify my life." So, I go, "I have the
phone. I understand that. But what are
the elements of the phone that I can try
take out of the phone so that I don't
have to take the phone out?"
Do you know what I mean? Yeah. And then
your friends don't lose you to your text
or your email or Instagram.
Yeah. The look down, you know, the look
down. And I So I'm I'm like trying to do
that because, you know, to your point of
like what's the bad thing about I don't
think
it's like it's a it's a it's an
unwelcome second system effect. It's a
thing that we didn't necessarily
consider would happen when we made our
phones, our flashlights, our phones, our
email, our computers, our recording
devices, our everything.
I think your strategy is much better
than what most people do, which is they
just try to use willpower.
And the problem is nobody has enough
self-control to resist every temptation
that a phone brings. Man, I wish you
were around when I was a kid just so you
could say that to my mom. No one has
enough self-control. Mom,
professional psychologist just said it.
Don't go anywhere cuz we got more what
now after this.
Is it true that willpower like is is a
finite resource? It's a there's a huge
debate about that. I think my read of
the evidence and I just to be clear um I
didn't buy a lot of the evidence when it
was coming out. So I this could be
confirmation bias
but I think that what looked like
ability is actually motivation.
So let me give you a classic example of
this. All right. So this is this is an
old old experiment. Not not today's
standards of rigor, but people are
brought into the lab and they have to
just write endlessly, okay, for hours
and hours and hours.
And you're told that you you're supposed
to write until you can't anymore
essentially. Uh so your hand is too
cramped.
And you finish writing.
And then you have to sign a form to get
paid
and no one complains that their hand
hurts while they sign the form. It's a
little context switch. and this task
that was impossible to you that you had
exhausted your self-control.
You cannot write anymore.
You can't. You're done. Oh, sign this
thing. Oh, no problem. Didn't even cross
my mind. And so, I think what a lot of
us have called willpower is actually
just motivation. It's not self-control.
It's a question of do you want this
outcome? Does it matter to you? Are you
excited about it? And if the answer is
yes, you're going to find the willpower.
So then are you saying that the
motivation exerted upon us by snacks or
junk food or social media is more
powerful than the motivation that the
gym exerts on us
in the moment? Yeah. Like in that
Yeah. Psychologists would say that the
the snacks are a want and the gym is a
should and the wants are they wants
exert a greater pull than shoulds do.
But we can outsmart the wants by making
the shoulds um built into our habits or
by making the wants less tempting. I
think that other people play a huge role
in this too. So um you know the the
famous marshmallow test.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
So the original version is uh we put a
marshmallow in front of you, you're a
toddler and you're told you can have it
now, but if you're willing to wait a
little while then we'll get
marshmallows. Exactly. And then the
amount of time that you delay the
gratification predicts your SAT score
and your grades in school. And it's
supposed to be a measure of your
willpower.
But to my point about motivation, um
there's a recent replication of the
marshmallow experiment where um some of
the kids are told that uh another child
will get a second marshmallow if they
can wait.
And what happens?
And their quote unquote willpower goes
up. They don't want to let the other kid
down. Is the other kid there staring at
them?
No.
They they just told about the idea of
another kid.
Yeah. Just knowing that another kid
could lose a marshmallow because of you
is enough to to amplify your motivation
and you wait a little bit longer. Are
you doing that because you care about
the the other kid enjoying the gooey
treat?
Yes.
Could be part of it. Are you also doing
that because you don't want to feel
guilty about letting that kid down?
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. But
it doesn't matter whether it's one or
the other or a combination of the two.
At the end of the day, I think my
Angelou said, um, I'm counting on you,
counting on me.
So, let's
that's what's happening here.
Let's let's let's take that, you know,
out of that world and think,
did they ask did they ever try playing
around with who the they told the kids
was going to get the marshmallow?
Cuz I'd be fascinated if like if they
said, "Hey, there's an adult in the
other room who'll get a marshmallow."
Hey, there's a grandmother who there's a
grandfather. There's a dog. There's a
sheep. Hey, the devil is in the next
room. And like Satan, and if you wait,
Satan will get an extra marshmallow. I
wonder what the result would be. And the
reason I ask it is because I think about
like extrapolating this to larger
society. And I go, it makes sense to me
that a kid would think of another kid
when holding out on taking a
marshmallow, right? because they go if I
get I'll get another one and they'll get
another one. Us kids get more, right?
What happens when that kid no longer
thinks that the other thing is like
Yep.
Do do you know what I mean?
I do.
And then the question I have for you is
how do we then overcome that in society?
Cuz we see it in everything, right? In
America, we're getting to a point where
Republicans and Democrats no longer see
each other as human beings. You know,
you take it everywhere. You take it
everywhere. You know, Israel Palestine
is a great example. And one thing that
always strikes me is when I talk to
friends, especially from the region, is
they'll be like, "Man, we're a lot more
similar than you guys think we are from
the outside, and this is a lot more like
heinous for us as human beings than, you
know, people sort of play around with
it." And I I so I wonder, is there like
a way to improve that or is there a way
to understand why we do or don't see
somebody as being
a kid in the other room who might get a
marshmallow? Oh, there there there so
many things we could think about there.
First one is
Lee Lee Ross did this experiment years
ago before it was nearly as polarized as
it as it is now. But it was Israel and
Palestine at the time. It was a test of
allegiance.
Uh so people are people who are strongly
either pro Palestine or pro-Israel are
presented with peace plans uh from the
other side
and the question is how do they feel
about them? And they're also presented
with plans from their own side. And it
turns out the content of the plan is
irrelevant. What matters is what group
you think created it. So if you're pro
Palestine, right, you're more excited
about the plan that is Israelis came up
with if it was labeled a Palestinian
plan than you are your own country's
plan if it was labeled an Israeli plan,
And I think that really just speaks to
your point about both in-group loyalty
and outgroup distrust or maybe even
dehumanization. So, we feel if we think
the idea is coming from somebody that we
don't trust or somebody that we don't
feel holds the same value as as we do as
a human, we're less likely to take on
that idea.
Throw it out. I think most psychologists
would tell you that uh the majority of
prejudice is driven not originally by
outgroup hate, but by in-group love.
Huh? Wait, wait. Say more about that.
Well, I think the the classic finding is
that like people will they'll they'll
attach to a group.
When they have the the most minimal and
trivial cues of groupness. Uh like you
know you can you can just put people in
a room together and say come up with a
name for your group and all of a sudden
that group is good and any group that's
not us well we have to treat them a
little bit differently.
It's that simple.
It it often is. We see it happen all
around us. So, one of the things Tim
Kundro and I did a few years ago was we
said, "Okay, part of what people don't
think about is they think about the
group that they belong to as um as part
of their essence. It's who I am."
But if you run the counterfactual, it's
very possible you could have belonged to
a different group,
So, we started out with a really simple
example. We did um Red Sox and Yankees
fans given that that's one of the most
intense rivalries in American sports. It
is indeed. What we did was we said, uh,
we want you to just, uh, write about
what it would be like if you're a
Yankees fan to have grown up in Boston.
And then they're less nasty to the other
side after doing that.
Why? It seems to be the case that they
start to see more similarities between
them and the people that they thought
were their enemy and they realize like,
wow, this deep allegiance that I thought
this was who I am.
It's actually just an accident of birth
or where my parents happened to live at
a given time. And then we said, okay,
well, what if what if this process of
counterfactual thinking could go bigger
than baseball rivalries?
So, we had people on opposite sides of
guns and abortion do the same exercise.
And we said, "Okay, if uh if you're
somebody who's um who's very strongly um
gun safety,
Uh imagine you grew up hunting um in,
you know, in the South with your family.
How might you feel differently?"
Um and we found that not only were
people um more open to having a genuine
disagreement with the other side, not
only more were they more willing to
listen to their challenging opinions,
they were more interested in dating
somebody who disagreed with them.
Oh, that that switched quick.
Yeah. Yeah. Wow. And all I mean this is
literally a one-minute intervention. Now
the problem is a lot of people won't do
the exercise in the first place, right?
So I sit down with somebody and I say,
"Hey Trevor, like imagine you'd grown
up." Well, I wouldn't have been raised
in those circumstances.
So I I think that's the next step is is
to figure out how to get people to
engage with that.
Yeah. It's I often I often wonder if
this is a
you know I I sometimes think of it as a
failure of leadership you know um
there's a so for instance America is a
good example you know the ascent of
Donald Trump I found particularly
interesting because he was the first
politician I had seen in America who
really made it zero sum in a way that I
I'd never really seen any polit
politicians do for you know it doesn't
matter if it's like George Bush it
doesn't matter if Bill Clinton there was
always an element of like reach across
the aisle and and now Trump has gone
like no actually forget that no reaching
no shaking hands no nothing you're scum
of the earth you know what I mean and
I'm in I'm intrigued by why
that attitude which we're seeing around
the world by the way I'm not saying this
is a Donald Trump thing why is that more
seductive than the people who say,
"Let's see it from the other side. Let's
shake hands. Let's think about this.
Let's find like why is it more seductive
if the other one makes us better human
beings to each other?"
I think it's not a coincidence, as you
said, that this is happening around the
world.
And I think that it's happening around
the world in a context of perceived
scarcity and fear of loss.
Oh, yeah. So the the American version is
like this is the first generation on
record that is not going to be better
off than their parents. And you if
you're sitting around worrying about
that all the time, it is really
appealing to have somebody who tells you
uh I alone can fix this.
So from a psychology standpoint, how do
we fix it?
The Heineken commercial was a good
start.
I'm sorry.
You've seen the Heineken commercial,
Which one? There there was there was
just a massive experiment where I think
psychologists submitted at least two
dozen different interventions to try to
bridge divides. Okay.
And the Heineken commercial beat all of
them.
The commercial.
The commercial. Yeah. Can we pull it?
This one.
I would describe my political views as
the new right.
I say that I'm left.
So it's a 4-minute Heineken ad where
essentially they bring people together.
They play us their I guess main belief.
Somebody said to me that climate change
is destroying the world. Then I'd say
that is total piffle.
You know, I'm anti-trans. I'm feminist.
Uh I hate feminists, etc., etc.
So transgender. It is very odd.
I am a daughter, a wife, I am
transgender.
They put the people who have the
opposing beliefs with each other. Then
they give them a series of tasks to
complete and then they expose to them
the main belief that other people have
that I guess differs and then they agree
and they sit down and they have a beer.
Even if you wanted to to convince people
about your point, the productive thing
to do would be to sit down. Just engage.
I've been brought up in a way where
everything's black and white, but life
isn't black and white.
Yeah. Just
now let's go back to what you said.
the ad itself.
Yes, this is the amazing thing is you
don't have to go and have the beer or
build the box with the person. You just
have to watch the ad. It's enough to
reduce your prejudice against the other
side.
Huh. Why do we think that is?
Well, I think what's what's happening,
and you can you can actually hear some
of it in the video, is we're confronting
binary bias, which is the basic tendency
that people have to oversimplify a
complex world into two categories.
Okay?
Um, you know, Republicans bad, Democrats
good,
right? and showing a 3D view of that and
sort of busting that um that bubble.
So, you know what's interesting about
this? You talk about coming around full
circle. In a weird way, it almost feels
like we
as adults should be living in a world
where we watch multiple parents arguing
because then it'll help us be more
creative in how we see our connection
with other people. Because if if you
think about it, if you show Americans
Republican and Democrat, they believe
that there are only two ways to see an
issue, there are only two outcomes to
every issue, and there are only two ways
to be, that then fundamentally means at
the end of the day, just I mean
averaging and odds and you're probably
going to end up at a 50/50 impass
because that's what it is. But if you
found a way to show them sort of an
anonymized
breakdown of views, people may be more
likely to come to more complex
conclusions about a varying set of
topics.
Yes. And I don't need you to think I'm
right. I just need you to recognize that
you might be wrong,
just as I know I might be. And actually,
Trevor, there's a really specific
example of this that if you were still
hosting the Daily Show, I would say do
it this fall. Um Sarah Conrath has
tested the effects of changing the maps
we show in election seasons and says
there's no such thing as a blue state or
a red state. They're just different
proportions.
And it turns out if you show people a
purple map with different shades, uh
they're actually more uh they're more
open to the other side and they show
less prejudice, less stereotyping, less
discrimination.
Oh, that's amazing. Why haven't we just
done that?
I don't know. I think we all should be.
Well, I think we know the answer to
Yeah. It's not as dramatic. It's not as
and I think you see like this is what I
this is what I mean is like not that
things are you know again not the binary
good or bad but if you look at like if
you look at incentives
in many ways I would say like the news
in in and around the world has
tendencies that the snack and junk food
industry has and that it is trying to
maximize. So if they show you a red and
blue map, it makes you feel like you are
engaged in a battle where one side is
encroaching and you are either winning
or you are losing, but you really see
this thing visually. Showing me a shades
of purplish map is just like you've now
just shown me the United States of
America, which is not scary, is not as
exciting. And so it's like in a weird
way, it's almost like that's what we
have to ask ourselves is where do the
incentives lie? If the news has an
incentive to keep you watching,
unfortunately,
that incentive will probably be best
served by them making you feel like
everything is always ending and then
people are coming to get you, right?
I think so. I don't know. I mean,
oh,
people are going to listen to this
podcast. They might even watch it.
We haven't discussed any urgent news or
any headlines. Yes,
there's there's a there's a huge
appetite for long- form, thoughtful,
complexified conversations.
Yes,
I don't think we figured out how to put
that on TV.
Yeah, in a weird way, it goes back to
the incentives and who's running them or
controlling them.
It does, but I think on the margins
there are still things we can do. So,
like we were talking earlier about uh
people not trusting science and I think
a huge reason why that happened is um
science was oversimplified. And so what
what we ought to say is, you know,
here's an initial study and the best
available evidence points in the
following direction, but here are the
caveats, right? You see that in any
scientific paper you read. Well,
journalists are afraid to do that
because they think it undermines
interest.
it doesn't. Um there are a whole bunch
of studies which I should caveat. We
don't know if if they're going to
continue to replicate, but
people are just as interested and they
read with healthy skepticism and they
appreciate the complexity.
So then let me ask you this.
Using everything you've taught me in
this conversation, how do you think you
will
bridge or re-evaluate your relationship
with the friend of yours who believes in
astrology and you had like a a little
like ranty bust up with? What do you
What do you think you can do now to
connect with them?
What do you think I should do?
I would start with the like apology.
Just be like, "Hey man, really sorry.
You know me, science. I put science
above everything and studies have
actually shown that people like me are
less likely to be open to a different
opinion and and so yeah man anyway it's
actually funny I wouldn't have usually
done that but Mercury's in retrograde
and that that probably contributed to my
inability to um connect with you as a
person and then if if they laugh then
you know you're in the space and then if
they don't you can be like I'm joking or
whatever then maybe you you know you
find like a little bridge and you know
their sense of humor and you know what
connected you in the first place and
then you go from there and then you're
like anyway how's and I think that is
enough I don't think you're supposed to
solve it there personally let's sort of
build a scaffolding around this this
fracture in the column of our friendship
and then when that scaffolding is intact
at some point you can come back joke
laugh connect and whatever cuz I don't
think you need to agree with your
friends on everything but if you get
back to remembering that they're a human
being I do find you can you can have
like a really wonderful relationship.
Well, you can even now mock each other
about that and just be like, "Yeah, of
course. What are you going to say about
that? What are you going to say?" I I
think that's what I would think.
I love this. Do you do you talk about
astrology again or do you just leave it
aside?
Yeah, but I think you it's it's it's
it's no different to a limb that is
injured, right? Why do we put people on
crutches? We put people on crutches so
that they can stay off the limb that's
hurt right now. in the long term, you
intend to get back on that limb and
you're going to do some physical
therapy. But for the short term, it's
like stay off of it and then next thing
you know, you're back at single leg
squats and and you're in the game. And I
think I believe that that point of a
friendship actually becomes greater
because now you have a rift that you've
repaired. And I sometimes think I
sometimes think the most important
connections you'll make are actually in
the rifts. I think those moments is
where like the the real like like core
of a friendship actually existed like
the strength of it.
Why?
Because I think you've now built a new
type of trust. You've shown to each
other that you have the ability to come
back from anything. And I think that
resilience might be more important than
just like a like a theoretical
willingness. And so you can then laugh
and go like, "Man, remember that fight
we had? Remember that  that went
wrong? Remember that? Wow, that was I
can't believe we man that was that's
what I think.
So you've you've proven your commitment
to each other also as part of that it
seems.
Yeah. Yeah. So that's what I'm trying to
work on in my life with people is I go
like all right I disagree with that.
Have we shored up every other part of
our lives? All right let's tap on that a
little bit. How you feeling about that
today? Let's chat a little bit more.
Have you seen this? What is your
perspective on this? I find that helps
me a lot with people as I go. I've read
this article. I would like to know how
you how you see this and how you
perceive it before I say anything. And I
find and that's maybe why I keep them
and and call them friends. I find the
people who I have in my life are willing
to say yeah actually that's not or this
is and I find over the years and over
the months our conversations have become
a lot softer at the edges than they once
would have been.
Uh this I think you missed a calling as
a therapist life coach.
No, no, no, no. Well, you do it
masterfully and I I can't help but react
to one thing that you just highlighted,
which is I don't think character is is
how you treat people when things are
going your way. It's how you show up on
a hard day.
And I think true character is what do
you do when your values are tested?
Yeah. What do you do when your values
are tested?
Damn. What do you do when your values
are tested? Well, we'll leave everyone
thinking of that one. Adam Grant, it's
always a pleasure chatting to you. Honor
is mine, Trevor. Thank you. It's a blast
as always.

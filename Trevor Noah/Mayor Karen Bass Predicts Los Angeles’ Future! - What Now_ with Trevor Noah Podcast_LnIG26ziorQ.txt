- Could we just make sure
everyone's recording?
- All right. I'm, I'm
recording on my side.
- I'm recording.
- I
- Not, one second, one
- Second.
I'm, I'm always recording.
Please note that all calls are recorded
for quality assurance purposes.
This is what now with Trevor Noah,
happy mayor of Los Angeles.
Karen Bassey, everybody
happy? Karen Bass.
Happy Karen Bass.
I love speaking to mayors
because after, after years
and years of speaking to
politicians, I have been told by,
I would say like the
majority of politicians
that mayors have the most
direct impact on, on your life.
Like if you live in a
city, a mayor has more
of an impact on your life than the
president of your country does.
And most people don't think this.
Most people are out there in the
streets, especially in America.
I've noticed, like in America,
it's all about national politics.
Christiana, I feel like of all of us,
you have the highest
stake in this conversation
'cause you are a resident of Los Angeles.
- I, you know, I do. And you know,
I've had some experience with mayors.
Boris Johnson was the mayor of London
and then became the Prime Minister.
So I have a lot of feelings.
I've had the worst mayors.
I had de Blassio, I had
Boris Johnson and Karen.
I have no view of it right now
because I mean, it's, she's
currently reigning as the mayor.
- I, I wanna speak to her about, I mean,
everything obviously, but,
you know, LA right now,
I think one of the big topics
obviously is homelessness.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I find that people are more angry
at homeless people than
they are at the situations
that make people homeless.
- For sure. Yeah.
- Like, they make it, they make it seem
like people leave home, kiss their family,
and they're like, all right
honey, I'm off to be homeless.
See you soon. Do you know what I mean?
And it's like, no one
wants to be homeless.
- Listen, especially, you
- Know how you know that
nobody Yeah.
You know how you, you know,
how, you know nobody wants
to be homeless is because
all homeless people
try to build homes. Have
you ever noticed that?
- Yep.
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Especially like in la
it's such an expensive city.
I think I've, I've only had the misfortune
and fortune of living in
really expensive places.
London, New York, la and this LA housing.
There's an affordable housing crisis here.
And it's just like, it's no
surprise that there are people
who have full-time jobs
and they live in their cars like that.
That's the thing that like blows my mind.
I'm like, you have people who are
doing all the right things.
Right? They went to school. Yeah.
They got a job or they
went, they have a trade.
Like they are contributing to society
- And
- They still can't afford an apartment.
And even if you're not
contributing to society,
I don't believe that you should
have to live on the street.
You understand? Like, that's
my view of the social contract.
And it's just LA is
terrifyingly expensive.
LA is a place where like,
rich people are nervous.
So that makes you think
like, what is going on here?
And I dunno, how does a mayor fix that?
Because I think LA in many
ways starts to suffer from all
of the bigger problems that America has.
Federally sometimes.
- Yeah.
- You know, I dunno,
- I hear what you're saying.
If it, if it comes up while
you're talking about the
homelessness and everything.
I had two questions if I could sneak into
- It depends on what they
are, Josh, but go ahead.
- Okay. Well, one is
about how you balance,
or if you can balance
making illegal something
that can inevitably happen to a person.
To me, the way that we've in America made
homelessness illegal.
- Yeah.
- Is like tantamount to making,
becoming old illegal.
- Yeah.
- But it's an inevitability under
certain circumstances.
- Yeah.
- Yes. And then
- It is, it is something that is
completely out of your control.
- Yeah. Yeah. And then the
second thing is about if she
feels the need or thinks
there will be a need
to override
or overpower the people
in the way that a lot
of la residents end up voting
against their own interests.
'cause they're worried
about their property value.
They don't want this piece
of land becoming Yeah.
Single family housing or whatever.
So then eventually someone
may have to step in
and be like, I know that you
think you're doing what's best
for you, but it's ruining everything.
And if she thinks the state
should have that type of power,
if she thinks she'll have
to do anything like that,
because it's gonna keep
getting worse, you know,
- It's a, it's a, it's the
classic case of Nimbyism, right?
Not in my backyard. Yes,
- Exactly.
- And it's so easy to
become that person, Trevor.
- Oh, it is. It is.
- But I'm like, Louis, who's that?
Who's that walking down the
street? Can you go and check?
Like, I'm like, who stole our lemons?
Someone's been stealing my
lemons from my lemon tree.
We have a lemon thief. Oh my And goodness.
And they take them in like bundles.
And I'm like, who is, you
just have to ask. Just ask me.
I'd give you my lemons.
There's a lemon thief.
And I'm like speaking to
the neighbors about it.
And I'm like, I'm supposed
to be a socialist,
and I'm getting furious about lemons. So
- Oh, wow.
- The nimbyism It happens.
It comes to all of us and we
- Just, it does it, it
does come to all of us.
Yes. It's funny, I used to
steal lemons all the time,
so well not steal.
Actually, I used to walk
around neighborhoods
with my mom when I was,
when I was younger,
and we would find all the streets
where people had fruit trees,
and all we would do is just take,
it was like blackberries. So you would
- Steal people's fruit,
- Blackberries, apples,
lemons, limes, peaches,
anything that we could find hanging.
I, we didn't even think of it as stealing.
It is a tree that is growing.
- No, no. I If the thing is,
they take a lot of the lemons,
Trevor, they take like
10, 10 lemons at a time.
And if you ask me, I
will give them to you.
- Wait, wait. How do you know, wait,
how do you know it's one
person taking 10 lemons
and not 10 people taking one lemon?
- That's a good point. But I, I,
my spirit tells me it's one
person taking a bunch of lemon.
I just, on a spiritual level,
you know, Nigerians, you know,
you know, when feel you can feel it,
you can feel something I something
- Inside said.
- I just know it. I just know it.
Maybe listen, people
knock on the door and ask.
I if you ask take,
- I have never thought an owner
of a lemon tree cares
about the lemons on it.
- I know, I know.
- I mean, the fact that
they even say like,
if life gives you lemons,
make lemon like the f
you know what I mean?
Yeah. That tells you
lemons themselves already.
Not like a a a sort after produce. Okay.
Some, because think about, think
about what that phrase even means.
It's like if life gives you
lemons, if life brings the worst
to you, try and make
something good out of it.
And then Christiana, there're
fighting like, this is my
- Worst.
I'm just, I'm just, I'm
just a grateful person.
- Okay.
- Even for the lemons in my life.
- When I was growing up in the township in
South Africa, nobody had anything.
And what I mean by that is, you,
you had the very bare minimum,
everyone had a basic structure.
You know, sometimes
you didn't have running
water inside the house.
So there was a shared tap
or faucet, you know, that,
that connected a few houses
that were outdoor toilets, et cetera.
Everyone had nothing the bare minimum.
And because of that, everyone shared
everything with everyone.
And what I mean by that is like space.
Like someone would walk
through your yard to get
to another yard
and it was just like, yeah, this is the
shortest way possible.
So you would walk through your
neighbor's backyards all the
time and you just greet people.
Hello, hello, hello, hello.
It was like, yeah. Yeah.
Because I mean, what do you,
of course you need to move
through my space to get
to another space and it's convenient.
I get that. And there, there
were all of these instances
where people were quote
unquote infringing on another
person's space.
But it wasn't felt that way.
It wasn't, it wasn't treated that way.
And interestingly, you'd see
one family in the neighborhood,
they would start to do,
well, you know, a parent
of theirs would get a job in
the city or whatever it was.
And then they would build a
wall would be the first thing
they'd build around their house.
The houses had no walls.
And then there'd be a wall.
And then they would put like
spikes on the top of their wall
so that you couldn't climb over the wall.
And then they would get
a car at some point,
and then they would get,
and it's amazing how
as the people got more
money, they became more
and more isolated from
the community around them.
They stopped speaking to people as much.
They stopped getting
the occasional weak tie
that would meander through their yard
and have a random conversation with them.
Their children played in their yard
and were never in the street.
And all of a sudden became
ostracized from the other kids.
And it's amazing to me how in
this machine that we live in,
we've all been conditioned
and we've all been taught
to get as much as possible.
But then in that, you know,
like, like the ring from Lord
of the Rings, once you have
your precious, you, you, you,
you are terrified of
sharing it with anyone
or anyone taking it from
- You. Yeah.
- And so you have to become
like a, like a, a goem
that goes into a cave and
hides with your precious.
And we don't realize what
we lose funny enough.
You know, and, and by the way, I,
I'm guilty of it in many ways.
I think many of us are. But you take
for granted what you lose.
You take for granted the fact
that you are constantly not
with the people around you
because you're constantly
afraid that they will want
to take the toasters in
your garage, when in fact
you don't need that toaster.
You didn't care for that toaster. Yeah.
And the thing you actually
need in your life is community
and somebody to look after your
kids who you actually like,
who you didn't hire from an app
who's forced to be on that app.
Oh my God. God. Because
they also don't have,
it's just like a, it's
just like a wild, you're
- Speaking my language.
It's funny. Lewis walks with
Obie every day to school. Yeah.
So he does about 10,000 steps a day,
which in LA makes him a crazy person.
'cause no one works. It really
does. Walks in LA every time
we walk in, we run into
friends who are driving.
They're like, why are you walking?
And Louis is, were like, well,
this is the way we see people
and we see the world and we
get to know our neighbors.
And in a car centric city like this, that
where your friends can live
completely across town.
Yes. It's really isolating.
And there aren't many
ways to actually find
that community you're talking about.
You know what I mean? Because
you're always in your car
or you are always at work, and then you go
and buy something from the
supermarket and then you come home.
- Yes. - And I, I, it's something
I've been being like, oh,
I'm in la I know all these people,
but I never get to see them.
And it's 'cause like, everyone's
in their own mini fortress.
And if you want to go on a date, you have
to hire a babysitter through an app
who may quit two weeks later.
Not that that happened to me,
but maybe it happened to me.
- Yeah. But yeah. Okay.
We're gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna jump
get ready for the mayor.
We're gonna talk about homelessness crime
and what it is like being the first
woman, I think.
And then the second African
American mayor in la
which is pretty wild.
It's crazy that in 2023 there
are still first anythings.
- Yeah.
- But let's get into it.
Mayor Karen Bass,
Mr.
Trevor Noah. Well, well,
well, how are you? Good.
We're rolling. Oh, okay.
Then, then we can, we can jump into it.
I guess jumping straight into it in,
in the most apt way possible.
Congratulations. You
just celebrated one year
- Yes.
- Of being the mayor of Los Angeles.
- Yes. It has been an exhilarating
year. Yeah. Really has.
- How many moments have you
regretted taking the job?
- You know what? I haven't.
- You haven't.
- I really haven't.
- No. Not even once.
- No.
- I don't know if I believe that.
- No, but I will tell you though,
I wake up some mornings going I'm a mayor.
But, but no regrets. No.
- It's, it's a massive job.
- It is.
- Being a mayor of any city
is, is a monumental task.
Being the mayor of Los Angeles is,
I mean, is akin to being, you know,
a governor in some places.
- Right? That's
- Right. And a president in other places.
- This is - True because of
how much your job entails.
Let's, let's get into that aspect of it
to help me understand,
and I think for many people
who will be listening to this,
what what is the mayor of Los
Angeles tasked with doing?
What is what, what is under your scope?
What are you capable of doing?
What are you not capable of
doing? What's the job of mayor?
- Well, let me give you
a couple of examples.
The job, Los Angeles
is one city in a county
of 88 cities.
Los Angeles just happens to be largest.
A mayor is not in charge of schools.
The mayor is in charge
of the police department
and 44 other city departments.
But social services like
healthcare and the jails
and other poverty related
programs, I'm not in charge of.
Huh. So I work in
conjunction with the county.
Now, the good news for me is that
because I've been involved
in politics, not just
as elected office, yes.
But I'm being on the
ground as an organizer
and activist, I have deep,
long-term relationships
with everybody on every level.
So that has helped me tremendously.
- It's funny you say, not
schools, particularly you.
I cannot tell you how many
people have said to me,
you're speaking to the mayor,
talk to her about the schools.
- Right.
- Talk to her about the schools.
- I'm happy to talk about 'em,
but I have no authority to go. Do you have
- No authority over them?
No,
- I do not.
- Do you, do you think
people know what you,
what you have authority over
and what you don't? Oh, no.
- Absolutely not. But I'm gonna
tell you something, Trevor,
this is my third office.
I was in the state office
and the federal office,
people have no idea
what any of these offices do.
So whenever I have a
community meeting, I have
to spend the first half hour doing civics.
- I wonder who, who do you,
who do you think we should blame that?
Is that, is that schooling,
is that education? Is it
- No, I think it's our American culture.
- In what way?
- Because Americans are very
apolitical, ahistorical.
Now ask somebody about a
sports team or a celebrity,
and they can tell you everything.
Ask them who governs the schools
and who takes care of the trash.
And I don't know. It's,
it's the Congress person.
- They can tell you exactly how many home
runs somebody has hit.
- Exactly. - But not who's
running their neighborhood.
- That's right.
- Your, your journey is in many ways,
almost, it's almost
perfectly designed for you
to be at this moment in your life.
You know, I was, I was
reading through your history
and through your life, and I mean, it's,
it's quite a story journey when,
when you were a young girl,
your, your father really, I
guess, inspired you and, and,
and, you know, through the
things that he showed you
inspired you to become an activist.
- Right. - You wanted to be
part of changing your world.
That's not what most kids want.
That's not what most kids dream of.
What was it about activism
that made you think, I want
to get involved in that?
- Well, you know what, I
think it was the time period,
the historical time period when I grew up
where change was happening
all over the country
and really all over the world.
So it was the Civil rights movement.
And as a kid, I was watching
it on TV with my father,
and he would explain to me
what the south was like,
because he was from the south.
- Right.
- He was part of that generation
that came post World War ii.
- And so you thought to
yourself, this is it.
- Absolutely. All I
wanted to do was hurry up
and grow up so that I could
be a part of a movement.
That's what I wanted to do.
- What was the first
movement you were a part of
- Really at school?
You know, working as a,
a middle school activist,
and then the first campaign I
worked on was Bobby Kennedy's
presidential campaign.
Wow. And I was in the ninth
- Grade.
Wow. What were you doing
as part of the campaign?
- Oh, you know what I did?
I signed up my mother to
be a precinct officer.
- Really?
- But I did it.
She never knew, not
until many years later.
So I went up and down my block.
I knocked on the doors
and I told them why I thought
Bobby Kennedy would be the best president.
- And what, what were
you saying at this age?
Was saying, saying, why did
you think he'd be the best
president?
- Well, you know, there were two
things that were happening then.
It was 19 67, 68. Yes. It
was the war in Vietnam.
And it was the student movement
and the Civil rights movement.
It was kind of the end of
the Civil rights movement.
The b Black power movement.
- Yeah.
- And I was talking about
how I thought he would end the war
and how I thought he would
improve, you know, civil rights.
And I was very passionate about it.
I believed it very deeply.
And then when he was assassinated,
my whole world just collapsed
because then I really kind of lost faith
and said, I mean, Martin
Luther King was killed.
- Right.
- Kennedy was killed.
And people, activists were
being killed every day.
Student activists, black
Panthers, you know,
there were always these murders.
And so that made me really
kind of, for a few years,
kind of lose a little hope.
So I left the country.
When I graduated high school, I was 17.
I had never been anywhere,
you know, my family,
I had never been on an airplane,
but I, I worked through school
and I graduated on Thursday
and I left the country on Tuesday
and didn't know what the heck I was doing.
- Where did you go?
- I went to London
and woke up the next
day in a hostel going,
what did I just do?
But fortunately I brought
a round trip ticket,
- But
- I, 'cause I thought I was
leaving. I mean, I'm done.
- You thought you were gone forever?
- Yeah, I did.
- What brought you back then?
- Well, fortunately I had
a round trip ticket. Right.
But when I was over there, they
were, people were protesting
to free Angela Davis.
And I knew Angela Davis.
I met her because she
was a teacher at UCLA,
and I used to ride my bicycle to UCLA
and sit in her classes.
And so I felt kind of
embarrassed that people
around the world were
- Fighting to free
- To free somebody I knew.
- Yeah.
- And so I went home
and I said, no, I need to go home
and I have to make change at home.
And that's where I've been,
- You know, making change is, is a, a task
that I think oftentimes
sounds a lot easier than it is
- Because
- I think many people want to make change.
Most people do not want to put
the work in for that change
to actually take place.
- Yeah,
- That's true. If I say to an activist,
what is the hardest part of
being an activist, they will say
to me, it's realizing how
slow change actually is
- On
- The ground.
How slow it actually is.
People talk about Karen Bass
before she was Karen Bass
working in state office
or in on a, on a federal level,
or as, as mayor, everyone says, you were,
you were connected to the people.
- Right.
- You had this affinity for the people.
That's right. For, for, for what was
happening on the ground.
I guess my question is, is two parts.
One, do you think that has led to,
or that has been part of
the reason you've been able
to be successful politically?
And secondly, what do you
think other politicians miss
by not being on the ground
before they get into politics?
- Well, I think what a lot of
people miss is their purpose.
Like, why are they running for
office? Why are they there?
- Hmm. - I think a lot of
people look at it as a career
or they say, well, I'm running for this
because I'm gonna run for that.
To me, I've always been
driven by the issues.
And I think it's always critical
to leave your ego outside
and stay focused on what
you're trying to do.
But Trevor, you hit it for why?
I've been happy now because
I'm back on the ground
and I'm back doing
things that I was trying
to do really 30 years ago.
- Right. - But I was, you know,
I was a community activist,
running a community organization,
but I didn't have the
authority or the power.
We were trying to deal
with homelessness in 1993.
We were trying to take over motels
and everybody thought we were crazy.
- Was it, was it worse back then or
- No, no, no, no.
It's no homelessness then was
in South Central and Skid Row.
- Okay. - And it was probably,
we didn't, we didn't count,
but I could guess it was
probably maybe three or 4,000.
And just think now in the city,
not the county, in the city,
it's 46,000.
- 46,000. 46,000 in the city
- Alone.
That's right. If you add the county,
you gotta add another 20,000.
That's why you see tents everywhere.
Before we didn't have tents.
There were shopping carts.
That's what homeless people
did, was push shopping carts.
And then the grocery industry
figured out the technology
so they couldn't get the shopping carts.
- And that's changed. And
that's why we see the tents now.
- Right. That's right.
- So let's,
let's talk about the issues
and I guess how they, I mean, they,
they're inextricably intertwined
with what you do now.
Right? When, when your campaign launched,
it very quickly became a national campaign
that was about a local, you know, race.
I, I, I don't think I've ever
seen a mayoral race get the,
the amount of attention
that this race did.
Oh. You know, you were running against
- Caruso. Right.
- And it, it was this race
where I think he was spending,
I think in total, he spent
a hundred million dollars,
$104 million, if my numbers are correct,
- That's right.
- On the ground.
- That's right.
- Your campaign spent $5 million. A little
- More, a little more.
Yeah. How much was it
exactly? I raised 9 million
and then other people
contributed five. So it was
- Okay.
So the, okay, so the
external contributions were
five and then Okay.
But I mean, still that's, that's
- Exactly right.
- That's a huge return
versus the spending.
Let's start with that. Do you
think there is too much money
in political races now?
- Oh gosh, yes.
And the problem is, is that
if you have personal wealth,
there are no limits at all.
I was subject to limits.
I mean, I could only
ask somebody for $1,500,
so my $1,500 and he could
write a $40 million check.
And it was, you know, he's
worth 5 billion. So, wow.
You know, a hundred million
is, I don't know, tip money.
- Wow. Yeah. That's a huge difference.
- Exactly.
- Was there, was there a part of you
that thought to yourself, what am I doing?
I'm running against this guy.
No, I mean, I mean, is the
guy who, he made the grove,
people were like, we love the grove.
Yes, I do too. He can make, can
he make all of La the grove?
It seemed like such a
wonderful proposition.
That's right, that's true.
And here you were running up
against what seemed like an immovable
- Object, right.
- Just grinding
and, you know, going from
one speech to the next,
from one issue to the to the other.
You were both talking
about the same issues,
but in very different ways.
- Right.
- And it seems like, I mean,
the votes turned out accordingly.
It seems like your message resonated
with voters in a different way
because la you know, like
many cities in America
and in the world, in my opinion,
post COVID has really been dealing with a,
an explosion of homelessness.
- That's right.
- Everybody has an opinion on this issue.
Very few people have offered solutions
in and around this issue,
- And very few people have an
understanding of the issue.
- Well, let's start with
that. What is causing this
rise in homelessness?
Why is it that you have just
as you said, in the city alone,
40,000 homeless people?
- That's right. Well, you
know what, it's important
to look at the categories of
people that wind up unhoused.
Yeah. They might not be
able to be in a house
because their wages aren't high enough.
But it also might be that
they've been evicted before.
Their credit is bad.
They were incarcerated.
They might be a teenager.
You know, there's 9,000
children who are unhoused
with their parents.
Wow. And then there's also
a lot of foster children
that when they term out
of foster care at 18,
they have no 18 or 21,
they have nowhere to go.
Or you don't have first
and last month's rent.
So there's the economically unhoused,
but, you know, the
fastest growing sector of,
of homeless people are senior citizens
who are in their late
sixties and seventies.
Maybe they worked in a
shopping mall all their life.
No, 401k, no pension.
You can't live here on social
security. Yes. If you even have
- It. Yes.
- And then they get priced
outta the rental market
and they are homeless.
- That has to be one of the
scariest stats I've read.
And in many ways, one of
the most pertinent I feel,
because when people have
conversations about homelessness,
I, I've, I've noticed that
there is oftentimes a,
it's almost like a resentment
that people have towards
the homeless themselves.
- Well, because they believe
that they're homeless
because of their own
fault or bad decisions.
Right. But, but they, and
they don't look at the
- Circumstances.
I mean, that says
something about a situation
that's larger than just like
people who wanna take drugs
and not live anywhere.
- Exactly. And that is a
common viewpoint that everybody
who is unhoused is either a
drug addict or mentally ill.
And of course, that does
comprise some people.
But, you know, if I was out
on the street for a couple
of weeks, I can't tell
you I wouldn't use drugs.
And I can't tell you that my mental health
wouldn't be compromised.
Right. A lot of times
it's the chicken and egg.
You know how some people get addicted?
They take meth to stay awake at night,
so they don't get assaulted.
You have women suffering
from domestic violence.
You know, there's a
lot. You have veterans,
and listen to this one, this one's crazy.
A veteran winds up homeless because he
or she might take veteran benefits.
- Yeah.
- Then that means they make too much money
to qualify for veteran housing.
So they have to choose between
their benefits or housing.
So all of these reasons are
why people wind up homeless.
You have a lot of people who
were formerly incarcerated
and they can't go home
because their brother might be a felon
and they don't have any place to go,
and nobody's gonna rent to them,
and no one's gonna hire them.
So, you know, it's a lot of circumstances
that have led to the explosion.
And what I describe is, is
that number one is the evisceration
of the social safety net
that we used to have,
- Which was
- Really bad.
Well, we had better he healthcare in terms
of substance abuse and mental health.
There were programs that
people could be in and,
and LA used to be a heck of a lot cheaper.
This city used to be affordable.
I remember that where I
worked as, as a young person,
worked part-time, went to school,
and still afforded to live on my own.
You couldn't possibly do that now.
So all of these reasons
lead to the problem.
But I also believe
that really bad policy decisions
were made when I started
Community Coalition 32 years ago.
That's when it was the war
on drugs and all the laws.
Instead of helping people with
addiction by drug treatment,
we just locked everybody up.
And then now 30 years later,
we're letting them all out to the street.
So the reason why I ran,
because I was perfectly happy in
Congress, you know, that you inter
- Yes.
- Interviewed me. I told
you how much I loved Africa.
That was my, yeah. Big thing.
It was a hard decision to leave,
but I was so afraid that if he won
that we were gonna have
flashbacks to 1990s
and we were gonna start
criminalizing the very people
because people get so angry.
That's why it was so
important for me to win
and to prove that the problem was solvable
by getting people out of
the tents and into motels.
- We're gonna continue
this conversation right
after this short break
on day one, after winning
the race, you, you,
you stepped into your role
and the first thing you did was
declare states of emergency.
- Correct. - Now, as I
understand that, that gives you
a breadth of power that you
don't necessarily normally have.
- Right.
- And it enabled you to do things
that you felt needed
to be done immediately.
- Right.
- One of those, which was controversial,
and I understand why, is you wanted to get
as many people off the
streets and into hotels.
Help me, help me understand this
and help, help the listeners
understand this concept
of taking people who don't
have homes, you know,
unhoused people, homeless people,
and then putting them into hotels.
Whose hotels are these,
who's paying for the hotels,
and why is that even considered
a part of a solution?
- Sure. Well, you know,
the interesting thing was
because we all went through
COVID, that's exactly
what happened in COVID.
So we didn't invent anything new.
- We
- Learned from that experience.
And guess what, nobody was going to hotels
or motels during that
time, so it was fine.
So we're not putting people
up in the Four Seasons.
We're putting people up
in the snooty fox. I mean
- Right, right.
- In, in motels that are in the community.
And I think that the motel
owners that didn't want anything
to do with us years ago realized this
was a pretty good deal.
They didn't have to rent
their rooms by the day
or in some places by the hour.
Right. They didn't have to
do that. They had guaranteed
customers, guaranteed tenants all month,
because we try to rent out the entire
- Motel.
- And then we contract as the city
with a community-based organization.
They provide the meals
and the social services.
So people aren't just
left there on their own.
They have counseling, they have services,
and they have three meals.
- Is this, is this a
viable long-term solution?
- No.
- Okay. 'cause in my head,
I don't think putting people
in a hotel forever seems like
it's gonna, it's gonna work long term.
No, even just as a, on a, on a cost
- Level.
Right. I think it's gonna
work for a few years. Okay.
But we are also fast tracking
the building of housing.
So that's the big problem
here in LA is that for
so many years, the no growth
or slow growth movement,
restricted building housing.
And so we didn't build
the housing that we need.
For example, the state
requires us, has required us
to build half a million units
of housing in the next 10 years.
Now, not we're gonna make that happen,
but literally we're required to do that
and we will be fined if
we do not accomplish that.
- And so is this, is this
a number that is based on
how the population is projected to grow?
- Exactly. And also what the
population's needs are now.
So for example, there's a lot of people
who are not considered homeless,
- But
- There's three families living in a
one bedroom apartment.
- Mm.
- And I consider that homeless,
unless they choose to live like that.
And, and not too many people do. Right.
They're living like that because
they need three paychecks
in order to pay the rent.
Why is the rent so high?
Because there is a, a, a
severe shortage of housing.
So because the no growth
and slow growth movements
were so successful all up
and down California, the
state legislature got tired
of the nimbyism on a local
level, started passing a lot
of state laws to preempt
the blocking of building.
And then what I was able to do, especially
after declaring a state of emergency,
it did give me the extra
power so I could cut
through the red tape to say,
let's fast forward building.
So that's what I'm doing now.
We are putting people in motels,
but we're also fast tracking the building
and that half a million units.
I'm not, I'm referring
to all types of housing,
not just housing for
the poorest in our city.
- Do you, do you think that
the homeless issue that we are seeing,
particularly in urban areas,
and particularly in, in, in, you know,
democratic strongholds
is a problem that is
in, in, in many ways, I feel
like it could be a problem
that is seen as a failing
of the whole party if it isn't worked on.
Because, you know, the
Democratic Party for
so long has said, we are the party
of the people on the ground.
You know, and, and where the
Republicans have said, Hey, we,
we are about business and
we're about, you know,
tax breaks, et cetera, et cetera.
But if you have democratic cities
that have high homeless populations,
it seems like the promise is failing.
It seems like, you know, the allure
of the idea isn't what's,
what, what it's supposed to be.
Do you, do you feel like
there's an extra weight on you
as a mayor of Los Angeles
to prop up, you know, one
of the legs of the
Democratic party's table?
- No, I don't feel that.
But I feel incredible pressure in order
to get this problem solved.
- Pressure from Absolutely.
From the people.
- Just, well, it's internal pressure.
I mean, this is why I'm, I'm
doing this, this is why I ran,
this is why I've loved my first year,
because nothing gives me
more pleasure than to go out
to the tents where the
people are, to talk to them.
And then to see them three
days later in a motel
or a week later, you know,
that I remember this one woman
who said she was taking
showers all day long
because she was so happy
that she could take a shower.
- Oh wow.
- You know, there's,
there's things like that Yeah.
That make it extremely rewarding.
- How many, how many people
have you moved by the way?
- In our program of
Inside Safe, it's been,
and that's where we're
getting you in a tent
and moving you into a motel.
- Okay.
- It's been close to 2000,
but this year as a whole, we've
moved 21,000 off the street.
And there's a variety of
ways we have done that.
- 21,000 people
- Right.
- Moved off the streets.
- Right. So they've moved off the streets
because we were given vouchers
and we were able to get people in housing
with those voucher vouchers.
That's been one of the
problems years pass,
including like last year,
LA turned back thousands
of vouchers to the federal government
because they couldn't
figure out how to use them.
Some of the red tape has been insane.
I'll give you two examples.
Make you crazy. Yeah. Please.
One is, I can't let you use a voucher
unless you prove income.
Well, you've been on a,
in a tent for five years.
How do you prove nothing?
- Right.
- And then I can't let you use a voucher
because you don't have
a government issued id.
Well, if you gave me a
motel, I'd have an address
where I could have a government issued id.
So I went to the federal government to hud
and fortunately, our great
HUD secretary, Marsha Fudge,
who I served in Congress with,
spent months talking to them.
And now they've waived that.
They said, well, you know what,
I'm gonna assume you're poor
enough because you've been
living on the streets.
- Right. Right.
- So that barrier went away.
So that allowed people to, to get housed.
- So it's, it's so crazy
how often you hear that
as a story in America.
It's like, it becomes the, the cycle.
It's, it's really just
chicken and the egg.
Chicken and the egg. Yep. Egg and chicken.
Chicken and the egg. You know,
I, I remember hearing a story
of a, a man who was living out of his car,
and he was sleeping in
the car in Santa Monica.
And then because he was sleeping
in the car, he got fined.
Because he got fined. He
now had to pay the fine.
He couldn't pay the fine.
And so then he got a summons.
- Right.
- He got a summons to appear in court.
He couldn't go to court
because he was gonna either
lose his job or go to court.
And so then there was a
warrant out for his arrest.
And then now he had a warrant.
And now here you, you have this person
who is now basically gonna go to jail,
possibly when all they were trying to do
well was sleep and live. Well,
- Well, he also might
have gotten his car towed.
- Yeah. This,
- And he can't get his car out,
which means he's now lost his car.
- Yeah.
- Which means he's lost his job,
which now he's in a tent.
- So, so have you, have you
found ways to decriminalize
- Yes.
- Being homeless
because it's, you, you know,
Josh, who, who's, you know, one
of the people on the podcast, we, we,
we talk about each episode
before we go on, he said
something that I really loved,
which was, he said, it's
interesting how America
will criminalize something
that may be inevitable
and out of your control.
- Right. - Because other
crimes are an action, an action
that you should have been able to avoid.
Being homeless isn't one
of those, how do you,
how do you criminalize
something like that?
And what have you done to,
if you've done anything to,
to decriminalize being homeless?
- Well, you hit on why,
what my concern was about
my opponent as that,
and that was my flashbacks to
the 1990s, is that the level
of anger and disgust in the
city toward the unhoused
population was so high.
- Right. - That I was afraid
if the wrong person won,
that they would just criminalize folks.
Because there was a lot of
talks about three strikes,
meaning I'm gonna give you two tickets,
and on the third ticket,
if you don't move,
or if you haven't
disappeared, I don't know
where you're supposed to go
to, then I'll arrest you.
Now you get arrested, you're
gonna be out in five hours,
and you're either gonna
be right back there
or you'll be someplace else.
It doesn't solve the
problem. That was my fear.
That was my drive.
So I didn't care how bad the campaign got.
That was my passion about
winning this election.
- It's a, it's a tight rope to walk.
As mayor, I always think, you know,
because you're in this
interesting position where
on the one hand you have
to deal with everything
that is happening.
- Right.
- On the other hand, you have to deal
with everything that people think Exactly.
Is happening. Yes. Yes.
And the think is oftentimes
more powerful than the what is.
Yes. If people feel
like there's more crime,
- Right.
- Then they, they think
there's more crime. Right.
So they act accordingly, even
if the crime hasn't gone up.
And, and I, I, I wonder
how you deal with that.
- The way I view it is
crime is an emotional issue,
and if your car was stolen,
there's a crime crisis.
- Oh yeah, definitely.
- And you do not
care about the data.
Or if you go back to
what you were saying a
few minutes ago in terms
of democratic cities, well,
the reason why crime is up is
because we've been too liberal
and we don't enforce the law.
- Yes. - But you could look
at Republican led cities
and the crime is even higher,
or definitely no difference regardless
of the laws that have been
passed. So why do, why do
- You think, why do you think
then the narrative is around
urban cities and democratic cities?
What, what, what do you think that is?
- Well, I mean, I think part
of it is race. Absolutely.
So you asked me, the
pressure I feel is the
nation's second largest city.
Absolutely. I feel the pressure
because the perception is,
and, and it is a deliberate narrative
that Republicans are good at pushing.
So look at New York, a
hundred thousand migrants sent
to New York, but we have
buses coming into la
but not to the extent
of Chicago or New York.
You can't tell me that's not done
to destabilize those cities.
And Chicago, you have a brand new mayor.
He's been in less time than I am.
He has to hope to host
the Democratic convention
in the next few months.
Imagine that pressure.
So some of it has been
orchestrated and pushed.
It's a Republican narrative.
And what's, what do we have in
common with the large cities?
There are predominantly people of color.
And so regardless of
what the crime rate is,
they will say the crime is out
of control in democratic led cities,
their murder rate is higher,
their crime rate is higher.
- Well, generally,
where there's more guns,
that there are more people being shot.
- You think,
- I find it, it's a very simple
stats to follow, by the way.
It's, it's not as complicated
as people would think.
- Right.
- But, but that doesn't mean
that LA doesn't have its issues.
- Yes.
- How do you, how do you find the balance
between being a mayor who is
actively trying to make people feel safe,
whilst at the same time
acknowledging that for a long time
people have felt and beyond feeling,
people have experienced over policing.
- Right.
- That makes them feel unsafe at the very
safe, at, in the, you know what I mean?
At the very same hands of Oh yes.
The people who are trying
to pro quote, unquote protect them.
Like how do you, how do
you find that balance?
Because I'm sure on the one
hand, every time you say police,
police force protect,
et cetera, there's going
to be a contingency of your base
who says, what, what
are, what are you doing?
Why are you even working with the police?
- Exactly.
- The police are, are the bad guys,
quote unquote, in many ways.
And then on the other hand,
you have a large part of your,
your constituency who will say, no,
why aren't you working
more with the police?
Right. Why aren't you fully
handing over to the police?
How do you, how do you strike
that balance? How do you walk the line?
- So one thing about, about a city,
and I certainly have to
to say this to some people
who come from either or
perspective, it's both.
And so I set up an office of public safety
that's a traditional office
works with the police
and fire, et cetera.
But I also set up an
office of community safety,
which is not looking at law
enforcement driven solutions.
So I have always been about
how do you prevent crime?
So when I started a community
coalition in the nineties,
the first thing we did was
organize a youth component
to recruit high school students
so they wouldn't get 'em in,
get involved in gangs because
we had the Crips in the Bloods
and a thousand homicides, you
know, that particular year.
Yeah. So I wanted
to divert young people
away from gang involvement.
And by the way, that was building
on my own life experiences
growing up because, and a
Panther party did that a lot.
Yeah, they did. As a matter
of fact, there was a lot
of gangs involved,
but they got young people
involved in politics.
So that's what I did.
That's, I got involved when
I was older in high school.
Then I was involved in a lot
of direct political activity,
whether it was protesting the war
or whatever was happening
at that particular time.
And so we, we involved a
lot of high school students,
and I have to tell you that two
of those high school students are working
for me heading up the homeless
effort, the street outreach.
- Wow.
- And they are now in their mid forties.
- That is amazing.
- Exactly. That's
- Actually amazing.
Do you, do you think, do you
think that the government,
both large and small, has done
a, has done a terrible job
of reaching out to people?
You know, 'cause it's interesting
you talk about the gangs.
I've always said, and I've
always been fascinated by
how gangs do the very thing
that governments say they're unable to do,
and that is reach out to every youth
and make sure that they feel involved.
- Right.
- There is no gang that ever says, ah,
you can't get to the kids.
There's no gang that ever says,
we can't get them involved.
They're not interested.
Right. They go out there,
they have outreach.
They really just try
and connect with people.
And I mean, it's towards,
you know, a, a violent cause.
Right. Unfortunately. But
the essence of it is, is,
is fundamentally sound.
Like, do you, what do you
think the government could be
doing to, to to, to reach out
and to connect with young people
to make them feel like there's a
hope that they can work towards?
- And you know, what I
found over the years is
that it is not difficult.
It's just that we are not
committed to doing it.
Because what we did is we
provided a safe alternative for gangs.
What a lot of people who
are drawn to gangs, a lot
of young people are,
it's a surrogate family.
It's doing what you described.
It's providing you protection.
It might be providing you an income.
It's providing you all
of these things in a way.
- Right.
- Well, if you
provided those things in a positive way,
people would not get involved.
But as a society, we refuse
to invest in long-term solutions.
We always invest in law enforcement
and suppression activities.
- Right.
- But we will not address root causes.
That's why I started the
organization in the nineties.
That's why we started the youth component.
And I'm happy to say that
30 some years later now,
it's been about three or four
cohorts, almost generations
of young people who graduate
out of that program.
And they become involved in
some way in their communities.
Now they're all over the country.
And we've tracked them and
stayed connected to them.
And now that program,
that model has been
replicated around the country.
But I do not find it to be difficult.
I find that we just refuse
to invest the resources.
- When, when you talk about enjoying
and exhilarating year
of being mayor, I wonder
what your most frustrating
moments have been.
I know you're a very positive person.
- Yeah.
- But I, but I'd love to know
what you wish you could have done more of,
or what you wish you could have done.
Like are there, are there
aspects of your job where you go,
I, I wish I could do this, but I can't
- Every day.
But I will tell you, I wished I knew
what I know now about the bureaucracy,
and I'm afraid that there's so much more.
I don't know. So in other
words, I gave you two,
two crazy examples.
Three, if you include the veterans who
- Don't
- Qualify.
- Yes. Right. The vouchers.
- But there's a lot
of internal bureaucracy that is just done
because it's always been done.
And that's one thing, that's one statement
that makes me crazy.
We do it this way because
we've always done it this way.
Well, how's that working out for you?
46,000 people on the street.
So d doesn't it make you think
that maybe there's a
better way of doing things?
- Yeah.
- So just the inertia of, well,
this is the way it's always been done.
Or for people who think,
well I can't do something differently.
That's where it's been
helpful that I never worked
for the city before.
So I feel like I just parachute it in
and this stuff looks crazy.
And so, and I'm, I don't
believe, I mean to me,
I'm not gonna violate the law.
But if it's not a law, then
don't tell me I can't do it.
If there's people dying on the street,
don't tell me I can't
get them off the street.
Hmm. But what our policy
basically had been up
until now is you have
to stay on the street
until we build you a house.
That's insanity.
You asked me whether or not we
would do the motels forever.
Yeah. No, it's way too expensive.
But what our city did
that New York didn't do,
or rather I should say, what we didn't do,
and New York did New York years ago,
invested in long-term interim housing.
- Yes.
- And New York also passed a policy
that says you have a right to housing.
So we never developed
long-term interim housing.
We said, we don't want
anybody in interim housing.
We want them permanently housed.
Well, that's just wonderful.
But then you have this bureaucracy
that it takes five years
to build something.
So I've been trying to dismantle all
of these bureaucratic hurdles,
but I had to learn them
and I wished I would've
come in knowing about them.
- What's, what's the one
thing you wanna do now?
Like if I know there's
something on your list Yes.
That you're working towards. Yes.
Something that you're trying to overturn.
Something you're trying to change.
Something you're trying to fix. What is
- It?
So we have the people in the motels,
and as I mentioned,
a community-based organization takes over.
But Trevor, we have stretched
these organizations way
beyond their capacity.
- Yeah.
- So now I'm trying to think of a new way
to provide the kind of supportive
services that people need.
Because I don't think
you stay in housing your
whole life for free.
Right. Well, that's a good
deal if that was the case.
But I think two years
with strong supportive
services should be able
to mainstream most people out.
But then there are people that
are profoundly mentally ill
who will need to be taken care
of the rest of their life.
So you asked me, what I hope
to do next is pay attention
to the service delivery for the people
that are in the motels.
And then fast track as fast as possible.
The building of housing.
- It feels like there was
a time in America when
mental health was maybe
not spoken about more,
but definitely dealt with more.
That's correct. It feels like
there was a That's correct.
It feels like there were more
mental, you know, hospitals.
There were, there were
places where people could go
for psychiatric care.
It. Right. And it, it almost
feels like that's fallen away
as, as an idea.
It's, it's like one minute
the hospitals existed
and now those hospitals
have sort of been replaced
by jails and prisons.
- Well that's one. A hundred percent.
What happened was 50 years ago
when Ronald Reagan was, was
a governor, and then he
goes on to be president,
basically dismantled all of the hospitals
because bad things were happening in them.
But we, we closed the hospitals,
but then we made a commitment
that we would build community-based
services. Never happened.
- Oh, okay.
- It never happened.
So now in California next year,
voters will have an
opportunity to vote for
what we should have done 50 years ago.
So you are a hundred percent right.
That's why it, us not
having enough money is a lie
because it costs way more
money to incarcerate somebody.
- Right.
- Than it does to take care of them.
Just like you asked me about gangs.
Our country, our city,
our state has refused
to invest in our people.
And especially people who are the poorest.
We have no problem saving the
world or destroying the world.
However you wanna look at it.
I mean, if it's the defense
budget, it's unlimited. Right.
We think nothing of 50
or $60 billion that we're gonna
give to another country for,
you know, a war that they're fighting
or rebuilding that they need to do.
But we refuse to invest
in American people.
This is the richest country
in the history of the world.
It is inexcusable for people
to be sleeping on the street.
- Don't go anywhere. 'cause we got more.
What now after this,
if there was one part of your
job that you could include,
like one thing that you
currently don't have
under your umbrella, but you
wish you did, what would it be?
What would you love to work on?
- Health.
- What
- Aspect of what?
It would be the health
department. It would be my ability
to control the health department
and some of the county agencies.
- What would you, what would you change?
- Well, I, I would
definitely infuse healthcare
in much bigger ways.
So for example, health is at the root
of a lot of homelessness.
But right now, homelessness is just viewed
as a housing problem.
And it's, and the disconnect,
because you know, my background,
by the way, I have a lot of lives.
One of my other lives was
working in the emergency room.
- Yes, yes. - As a nurse and
all that. Right. PA nurse.
And so I do not understand,
it does not compute to me
that you don't see the relationship
between health and homelessness.
I met a woman in a temporary housing
who became homeless
because she had cancer.
So she was sick. She didn't
understand why she was sick.
She kept missing work. She got fired.
She went to, the doctor,
discovered she had cancer.
She didn't have healthcare either.
- Oh no.
- So she wound up living in her car
and then she lost her car.
And then she wound up
living on the street.
And I met her as she was
on the men, you know,
she was in a temporary housing.
Yeah. So a lot of health
conditions out there.
Everybody thinks about substance
abuse and mental health.
- Yeah. - But I've seen diabetes,
I've seen heart disease,
I've seen high blood pressure.
I've seen a lot of
different health issues.
- Especially living in a country
where people cannot afford
to get sick, you know?
Right. That's one of the biggest
things I've noticed people
terrified of in America.
You know, when I'm, I speak to
random people, when I listen
to stories, people will say,
my greatest fear is that I will get sick
- Right.
- In this country. Because
the first thing I need
to do is go see a doctor.
I don't know if I can
afford to do that. Right.
And then if I eventually
do get to see a doctor,
the thing they tell me may be
the fact that I cannot afford
to live anymore.
And so they wait until it's too late.
It's an emergency room issue.
- Right.
- And as you, like you say,
before you know it, someone's
living on the street
because they spent their life savings
trying to save their life.
- Well, prior to Obama
and the Affordable Care Act,
health was the number one,
the leading cause of bankruptcy.
The leading cost. But I have
to tell you something, Trevor,
when I worked in healthcare,
this was not the case.
Healthcare was not always
a for-profit industry.
That changed in the eighties.
One thing that was completely
considered inappropriate was
advertising medicine.
Yeah. Advertising healthcare
that wasn't legal.
- It's really strange when
you see it, by the way,
when you come from another country,
every second ad in the US is
like a pharmaceutical ad, a drug ad.
And it's really strange.
Ask your doctor about,
and it's like, what?
- But it'll tell you 20 reasons
why you'll die if you take
this medicine too.
Which by the way is completely legal.
Meaning that it is to protect them from
- Lawsuits. Right.
- It really isn't medically based.
- You are somebody who all
your colleagues have, have,
have labeled your two things.
They say you are, you are tenacious
and they say you are motivated,
and even speaking to you,
I can see you, you have a,
you have a cautious optimism,
but also a joy in, in trying
to solve the problems. You, you,
- I do.
- Yeah. You, you, you have a, you, you,
you take pleasure in, in,
in solving the puzzle.
Before I, I let you go,
I'd love to know what now.
I mean, we, you know, we've
talked a little bit about
working with the homeless crisis.
We, we've talked about, you
know, law enforcement and,
and it's, it's broader state right now.
But if we look at year
two, going into year three,
and then your final year as, as mayor,
what would you hope the
people of Los Angeles
and maybe the people in other
parts of America would see?
Because I think many of the
issues in LA are mirrors
or different versions of issues
that you see all across the country.
So what would you hope to now
do going from year to year?
- Well, I want, at the end
of my term, I want people
to believe, to believe that
the problem is solvable.
Meaning it won't be solved,
but that they can see the way out of it.
- Hmm.
- And by the way, I mean,
we have the World Cup coming in 2026.
- Yes.
- A Super Bowl in 2027.
Two Olympic Games in 2028.
So I am hoping that that
will serve as a catalyst.
I mean, the reason we're
getting the Olympics is
because we don't need to
build any major stadiums.
- Yeah.
- So I'm trying to run around
and get everybody to say,
when the Olympics comes,
we can't hide 70,000 people.
'cause then you're
talking about the county.
- Yes. Yes.
- We can't hide them.
The games aren't gonna be for one day.
So we either solve this now
or what the news coverage is
gonna be, wonderful games,
wonderful venues.
And then they're gonna cut away
and show the contrast in this city.
People are living like this.
They're left to live in destitute.
So I'm trying to get all of the movers
and shakers to see this
is our alternative.
And I actually believe that
we can get there. I really do.
- I really, I, I really
hope so. Wow. Okay.
Well, mayor Karen Bass, it's funny.
Every time I speak to you,
you have a different title in
front of your name, which is,
which is really fun for me. This is
- The last one.
- Oh, it is?
- Yes.
- What does, what does
- That mean? This is the last one.
That means I'll run for reelection.
I'm done with elected office after that.
- Huh? Oh, no. I have to
ask why before I let you go,
- Because it, it's enough.
Yeah. I mean, I think it's, you know,
I think it's, it'll be time.
It'll be time. But I will
always be involved in change.
- Okay.
- I'm not somebody that ever planned
to do this all my life.
- Yeah.
- I was doing a lot
before this, so I'll always
be involved in change,
but I don't need to be an
elected official until I die.
- Huh. I like that for you. I
like that. And you know what?
You you, you deserve it.
You deserve it. Thank
- You. Thank you. Thank
- You.
Well, thank you so much. Congratulations.
- Great to talk to you. Yeah.
- Congratulations on the year.
It's, it's really
wonderful seeing you again.
And you know, I hope when
we're chatting in a year,
we'll be celebrating the next achievement
and the next one and the next one.
And I wish you the best of luck
because I think everybody wins if you win.
- Thank you. Thank
- You, thank you. Thank you.
